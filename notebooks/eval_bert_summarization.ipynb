S. elections still seemed far away  —     back before anyone had heard the name Fancy Bear and before   everyone knew John Podesta’s risotto secrets  —   I was in Moscow   talking to a Russian who had previously worked in the Kremlin. ’ ’ Over the course of a   conversation, it became clear   that we agreed on one key characteristic of Vladimir Putin. This is tame, by the way, in comparison with the      rhetoric of Russian TV host and propagandist Dmitry   Kiselyov, who claimed the U. S. establishment might kill Trump   rather than let him become president  —   but such bombast is   intended for domestic consumption and not to influence the U. S.   vote.) And yet, for all this effort, what has been achieved? It is too early to be sure, but if anything, the hacks   actually seem to be doing the unthinkable and bringing Democrats   and mainstream Republicans together in their shared anger at   Moscow. ’ ’ With his      antics, though, Putin appears to have managed to   convince Clinton and those around her that the Kremlin represents   a clear and present danger to American democracy and Western   unity. Even the spooks who orchestrated all this have their qualms. These are relatively meaningless  —   but do   attract alarmed attention from the West. And America’s increasingly bitter and divided political landscape   produced an exceedingly hostile presidential campaign that   maximized the impact of strategic leaks and other “active   measures”  —   as the Russian spooks call political operations. He is focused on what he   can accomplish tomorrow, without necessarily thinking through to   what the consequences may be the day after. When the Kremlin decided to intervene in Ukraine’s Donbass   region, arming local malcontents and sending men and guns to back   them, it must have looked like a shrewd tactic. Kiev, the   thinking went, would be forced to capitulate, and Moscow could   claim not to be involved.',\n",

S. intelligence agencies have assessed that as the 2016 presidential campaign progressed, Russian government officials devoted increasing attention to assisting Trump’s effort to win the election, the U. S. official familiar with the finding told Reuters on Friday night, speaking on condition of anonymity. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. Protecting the integrity of our elections is hindered when   Trump and his transition team minimize or dismiss the intelligence assessments themselves,” Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said in a statement issued on Saturday.

We may be missing the forest for the trees in the Russia story: The Kremlin’s attempt to meddle in the 2016 U. S. presidential election is part of a much bigger tale of Russian covert action  —   in which Donald Trump’s campaign was perhaps a tool, witting or unwitting. Unless the United States stands solidly with its allies, Lavrov’s claim may prove accurate. Let’s look at Germany, which faces parliamentary elections in September.
