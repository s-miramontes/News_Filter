Mr. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence agencies’ conclusions as politically motivated, but he appeared to soften that stance in a statement his transition team released after the briefing.

Meanwhile, on   channels, Russian military officials talked darkly of preparing to intercede in Georgia to restore order.

He even had the nerve to compare Reid to Putin  —   when his own candidate is playing the role of Putin’s pet poodle. He underscored that lots of countries, including China, have been hacking the United States. “ Trump not only invited more Russian espionage and suggested Russia might get to keep Crimea but also demonstrated his utter unfamiliarity with the issue and his desire to buddy up to Putin as the latter seeks to damage the West.

She has repeatedly said that she will cooperate if asked to speak.) One of the aides to speak is Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s closest and   confidants. It’s not clear what other staffers have been interviewed. Also this week, the hacker Guccifer —  most famous for publishing George W. Bush’s paintings —  claimed he had hacked Clinton’s server, though FBI investigators apparently see no basis for the claim. The good news for Clinton is that there appears to be no evidence so far that she broke U. S. law, both CNN and The Washington Post report. Investigators reportedly still want to interview her. Besides, as the case has shown time and again, the leaks making it to the press have not always been reliable. The fact that Clinton was using a private server for her work email emerged in the course of the investigation into the September 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, which killed four Americans. The canonical case is Whitewater, a failed   investment Bill and Hillary Clinton made in 1978. Initially, it seemed that the interest in the emails would stem from damaging things that Clinton or other aides had said:   misrepresentations, who knows? The question is whether any of it, and how much of it, was classified at the time it was sent. Before becoming Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl Mills worked for Clinton on an unpaid basis for four month while also working for New York University, in which capacity she negotiated on the school’s behalf with the government of Abu Dhabi, where it was building a campus. She also earned money from the Clinton Foundation and was paid directly by Hillary Clinton. At the same time, Blumenthal was drawing a check from the Clinton Foundation. Blumenthal was apparently the source of the idea that the Benghazi attacks were spontaneous, a notion that proved incorrect and provided a political bludgeon against Clinton and Obama.

From the suffrage processions of the early 20th century to the Tea Party rallies of 2009, marches have drawn attention to crucial issues, occasionally resulted in violence and often prompted opposing gatherings. Are they continuing to be fired up when they get back? Woodrow Wilson skipped the event, taking side streets to a hotel to avoid the crowds. But the 1913 march kicked off a series of political actions that swayed the public and male politicians, finally pushing them to pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. The Bonus Army gathering, in which an estimated 20, 000 World War I veterans demanded the payment of bonuses guaranteed under a 1924 law, is among the   marches in American history. The gathering was followed by sustained activism  —   including a   drive in Mississippi and a march in Alabama from Selma to Montgomery  —   that helped pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Three drummers led the procession, followed by people carrying 11 coffins bearing names of the dead. A year after Roe v. Wade, on Jan. 22, 1974, thousands gathered in Washington to urge Congress to support a constitutional amendment, known as the Buckley Amendment, which would have effectively overturned the decision.

Historical significance is embedded in the event’s name: To march in Washington evokes the legacies of powerful public demonstrations in American history, such as Martin Luther King Jr. ’s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the Moratorium March to End the War in Vietnam, the Million Man March to highlight the collective power of the   community, and the 2004 March for Women’s Lives as a demonstration for reproductive and women’s rights. Organizers are hoping to create a social movement, but Marcia Chatelain, a faculty fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Social Justice, said doing that depends on whether the Women’s March’s momentum can be sustained long after the march itself. ” Organizers and activists can use the march to proffer alternative ways to create change in their communities and contribute to a greater movement from a local, everyday standpoint. ” It’s about the everyday acts of resistance that the marches are also trying to represent. To affect policy, Kazin said, a march needs to be part of a greater social movement with clear and consistent objectives, constant pressure on the Legislature, dedicated support from its base and continued momentum.',\n",

Some marchers also appear to be seeking out opportunities for activism on their own. Abby Wright, 36, who traveled from Atlanta, Georgia, to march in Washington, was not involved in political activism prior to November. She has since joined her local   association and is working on a website that seeks to keep residents of her district informed about local policies. Does a successful movement require cooperation with the other side, or can women effect the change they want through sheer resistance?

In an opinion piece for The Huffington Post, Zhou’s friend Chi Nguyen called out some of these white marchers for failing to chant “Black Lives Matter” and for ignoring   speakers during the   rally. Black women have been shot in the streets and discriminated against for years. In an essay explaining why she would not attend the Women’s March, Jamilah Lemieux notes that many white women have not responded to the crises of minority communities with the same force they’re deploying now, in response to perceived threats against themselves. NOW’s Terry O’Neill said that women of color have every right to be skeptical. In order to succeed, she added, white women of the movement will have to reckon with this critique if they want to fulfill the march’s goals of unified political resistance.',\n",

Most of those who have left have done so of their own accord; comparatively few were deported. Republican rhetoric on immigration has not caught up to those numbers, nor to the reality that the U.

              "  2: '(CNN) Two   opponents of illegal immigration have obtained   advisory jobs at federal immigration agencies in the Department of Homeland Security. CIS and FAIR are think tanks based in Washington that advocate restricting legal and illegal immigration. While at CIS, Feere promoted legislation to end automatic citizenship for   children of undocumented immigrants. The Pew Research Center also has found that the number of babies born to unauthorized immigrants in the United States has been declining steadily in recent years. In one article published by CIS, Feere questioned whether children brought to the United States at an early age were sufficiently assimilated or loyal to this nation to be granted any type of legal status. ”CIS has published articles that labeled immigrants ’third world gold diggers’ and that blamed Central American asylum seekers for the ’burgeoning street gang problem’ in the US, while Dan Stein has said that many immigrants that come to the US hate America and everything the country stands for,” said Heidi Beirich, director of Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, which oversees the center’s yearly count of   groups. ” Feere, Kirchner, acting ICE Director Homan and acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner McAleenan declined requests for interviews. Some   advocates already sense a growing breakdown in their ability to effectively get information from ICE. During the Bush administration, a coalition of   groups known as the   Working Group started holding confidential,   stakeholder meetings several times a year with   immigration officials as an opportunity to express concerns and ask specific questions about enforcement policy, the rights of immigrants and their treatment while in detention. In February, at the first such   under the Trump administration, members of the working group felt blindsided to discover that some     groups also were in attendance. advocates have told ICE they would prefer if the agency met with those groups separately, which ICE has declined to do. The agency continues to expand engagement with stakeholders and community members. Peter Robbio a spokesman for NumbersUSA, a group that also scored its first invitation to the stakeholder meeting, described this as the best relationship the organization has had with any administration in 21 years.',\n",

Borjas’ message is that the United States is not just attracting the best and brightest immigrants from around the world —  it’s also attracting a large number of poor, uneducated, unskilled immigrants, who he says are more of a burden to the American economy than a benefit. Limiting immigration to   immigrants, he argues, is the best solution if the point of immigration law were to make all Americans wealthier. “ While Borjas insists his focus is on pure economics, there are racial implications of his analysis. Borjas attempts to differentiate between the economic circumstances of a certain group and their nationality. Comments like these risk painting a whole group as dangerous, when in reality the vast, vast majority of people will come to America and lead peaceful, productive lives. The Naturalization Act of 1790 first established that only free, white immigrants could become U. S. citizens.

The language in the order says that any unauthorized immigrant convicted of any crime can be deported. Another tool implemented by George W.

Trump’s order said explicitly that he wanted “to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer. ” If they couldn’t prove citizenship, local authorities handed them over to ICE. This was used most pervasively, and attracted the most attention nationally, in Phoenix. There the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, led by Arpaio, descended upon   neighborhoods and stopped people for trivial traffic violations, emptied out restaurant kitchens, even arrested workers at local water parks, like in the case of Rayos.',\n",

Different research groups use different methodologies, and in some cases, they rely on estimates. We’ve included links to all our data sources so you can read about their methods in more detail. Mexico is ”the leading nation of origin for U. S. unauthorized immigrants,” Pew writes, but the share of immigrants from Mexico is also declining. The population from that one country far outnumbers the population from entire continents. The percentage arriving from Mexico has dropped markedly, while more immigrants are coming from Africa, Central America and Asia. The Department of Homeland Security has estimated that as of Jan. 4, 2016, about 416, 500 people overstayed their visas in fiscal year 2015. Still, it’s unclear how many visa overstayers make up the total number of unauthorized immigrants. A Pew estimate from 2006 says it could be as high as 45 percent. You probably know that people living in the U. S. without legal status, as well as other immigrants, are a big part of the farm labor force. Far, far more work in service jobs or in construction. That’s far more than the number who live only with noncitizen children  —   that’s just 6 percent of the population.'}]"
