              "['Chaos in the Family, Chaos in the State: The White Working Class’s Dysfunction Michael Brendan Dougherty is bitter. I think that I can write that in both truth and charity. (I think you might even say that he and I are friends.) Dougherty is a conservative of the sort sometimes advertised as “paleo” and served as national correspondent for The American Conservative. Like many conservative writers with those associations, Dougherty spends a great deal of time lambasting the conservative movement and its organs, from which he feels, for whatever reason, estranged  —   an alienation that carries with it more than a little to suggest that it is somewhat personal. You know: Them. Donald Trump is the headline, and explaining the benighted white working class to Them is the main matter. Sanctimony is the literary mode, for Dougherty and for many others doing the same work with less literary facility. Never mind the petty sneering (as though the conservative movement were populated by septuagenarians who say things like “learn computers”) and the rhetorical need to invent moral debasement (tax cuts are good for the rich people in Connecticut who don’t use cocaine, too) and Dougherty’s ignoring out of existence those   parts of the economy that are outside of the Manhattan —  Connecticut finance corridor. And never mind the math, too: It is really quite difficult to design federal tax cuts that benefit people who do not pay much in the way of federal taxes. Set all that aside: What, really, is the case for staying in Garbutt? RELATED: If Your Town Is Failing, Just Go: A Prescription for Impoverished Communities, There was no Garbutt, N. Y. until 1804, when Zachariah Garbutt and his son John settled there. They built a grist mill, and, in the course of digging its foundations, they discovered a rich vein of gypsum, at that time used as a fertilizer. A gypsum industry sprang up and ran its course. Then Garbutt died. “As the years passed away, a change came over the spirit of their dream,” wrote local historian George E. Slocum. “Their church was demolished and its timber put to an ignoble use their schools were reduced to one, and that a primary their hotels were converted into dwelling houses their workshops, one by one, slowly and silently sank from sight until there was but little left to the burg except its name. ” Slocum wrote that in . . . 1908. The emergence of the   wallboard industry gave Garbutt a little bump at the beginning of the 20th century, but it wasn’t enough. The U. S. Census Bureau doesn’t even keep data on Garbutt. To invoke Burkean conservatism in the service of preserving a community that was exnihilated into existence around a single commodity and lasted barely a century is the indulgence of absurd sentimentality. Yes, young men of Garbutt  —   get off your asses and go find a job: You’re a   bus ride away from the gas fields of Pennsylvania. Stonehenge didn’t work out, either: Good luck. Garbutt is Trump Country, and Dougherty, while not a   Trumpkin, is generally sympathetic to Trump’s critique of current American economic policy, namely that international trade and immigration are dispossessing the white working class. There is not, in fact, very much evidence for those claims: Immigration does put some downward pressure on wages, but it also puts downward pressure on prices.     workers’ money income may have stagnated, but their real income  —   what they can buy with the money they earn  —   has continued to improve modestly. The main effect of new immigrants’ wage competition is felt in the wages of earlier immigrants. But the effects of immigration overall are tiny compared with the effects of factors such as   expenses. In many   occupations, overall compensation in fact has gone up over the years, but the additional compensation has come largely or entirely in the form of medical benefits. In some cases, the expense of medical benefits has gone up so much that total compensation has increased even while money wages have gone down. That’s the worst of all possible worlds: It costs more to employ those   American workers, but they don’t feel any richer  —   and if their employers are paying more for the same benefits (or paying more for inferior benefits under the   Affordable Care Act) they aren’t any richer, practically speaking. On the trade front, American manufacturing continues to expand and thrive  —   an absolute economic fact that is, perversely, unknown to the great majority of Americans, who believe precisely the opposite to be the case. Americans have false beliefs about manufacturing for a few reasons: One is that while our factories produce much more than in the past, they employ fewer people another is that we tend to produce capital goods and import consumer goods  —   you won’t see much labeled “Made in the USA” at Walmart, but you’ll see it on everything from the aircraft flown by foreign airlines to the robotics in automobile factories overseas. Another factor, particularly relevant to the question of manufacturing and trade, is that a large (but declining) share of those imported consumer goods comes from China, a country with which we have a large trade deficit. That isn’t because the Chinese are clever, but because they are poor: With an average annual income of less than $9, 000, the typical Chinese household is not well positioned to buy   goods, which are generally expensive. (China is a large consumer of U. S. agricultural products, especially soybeans.) Add to that poorly informed and sentimental ideas about what those old Rust Belt factory jobs actually paid  —   you can have a 1957 standard of living, if you really want it, quite cheap  —   and you get a holistic critique of U. S. economic policy that is wholly bunk. Which isn’t to say that the Mikes of Dougherty’s world have it good  —   they don’t. But they aren’t victims of the wily Chinese, scheming to make them poor: In the story of the white working class’s descent into dysfunction, they are the victims and the villains both. RELATED: The White Ghetto: In Appalachia, The Country Is Beautiful and the Society is Broken, The Washington Post’s “Wonkbook” newsletter compared the counties Trump won in the   Super Tuesday primaries with the demographic data and found trends that will surprise no one who has been paying attention (and certainly no one, I hope, who has been reading this magazine). The life expectancies among    white Americans have been plummeting in an almost unprecedented fashion, a trend not seen on such a large scale since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the social anarchy that prevailed in Russia afterward. Trump counties had proportionally fewer people with college degrees. Trump counties had fewer people working. And the white people in Trump counties were likely to die younger. The causes of death were “increased rates of disease and ill health, increased drug overdose and abuse, and suicide,” the Post’s Wonkblog website reported. This is horrifyingly consistent with other findings. The manufacturing numbers  —   and the entire gloriously complex tale of globalization  —   go in fits and starts: a little improvement here, a little improvement there, and a radically better world in raw material terms (and let’s not sniff at those) every couple of decades. Go back and read the novels of the 1980s or watch The Brady Bunch and ask yourself why    suburban families living in large, comfortable homes and holding down prestigious jobs were worried about the price of butter and meat, and then ask yourself when was the last time you heard someone complain that he couldn’t afford a stick of butter. That change happened a little at a time, here and there. RELATED:    Deaths Are a Cultural Problem, The   numbers, on the other hand, came down on us like a meteor. Before the war, divorce had been such an alien phenomenon that it animated such   stories as The Gay Divorcee, a play in which a fictitious act of adultery had to be invented to move the plot forward. Divorce in 1960 was so rare as to carry a hint of scandalous glamour, which it kept throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with women’s magazines writing lifestyle pieces about informal weekday dinner parties for divorcées (the word itself is today faintly ludicrous) and men’s magazines celebrating divorce as a second adolescence. The divorce rate doubled over the span of a few decades  —   even as the marriage rate was declining. Add to that the violence of abortion, which fundamentally alters the relationship between men, women, and children, and what exactly “family” means to those of us born around the time Roe v. Wade was decided becomes a very difficult question. The concept of the nation as an extended family is the notion that separates   conservatism, with its roots in the   ideas that informed the American founding, from       European nationalism. In Europe, this is an idea popular with the Right: It is entirely unsurprising that Trump has enjoyed the endorsement of, among other European rightists,   Le Pen. In the United States, it is an idea  —   and an error  —   popular on both sides of the political divide: The distastefully squishy progressive writer George Lakoff argues that the American Right prefers a strict patriarchal model of the family and, therefore, a similar model of political life, while the Left is inclined toward the maternal and the nurturing. (  critics of free trade and free enterprise in the   world often speak of “nurturing” economic policies, because they do not wish to write the word “socialism. ”) But it is an idea that fits at best uneasily with the aspirations of American conservatism. One of the worst errors in public life is the common one of mistaking the metaphor for the thing itself. In reality  —   and reality is not optional  —   the president isn’t the national dad (Governor John Kasich’s insistence notwithstanding) and government is neither paternal nor maternal. The nation isn’t your family. Your family is your family. RELATED: The Buchanan Boys: The Trump Voters Aren’t a New Phenomenon, The metaphor points both ways: Nationalism may speak to a longing for lost national greatness, but in our own time, it speaks at least as strongly to the longing after  —   the great howling lamentation for  —   the ideal family that never was lost, because it never was formed. The Mikes of the world may be struggling to make it in the global economy, but what they really are shut out of is the traditional family. The current social regime of illegitimacy, serial monogamy, abortion, and liberal divorce has rendered traditional families optional, at best  —   the great majority of divorces are initiated by wives, not by husbands  —   and the welfare state has at least in part supplanted the Mikes in their role as providers, assuming that they have the wherewithal to fill that role in the first place. Traditional avenues for achieving respect, status, and permanence are lost to them. Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart London has done more to put homosexual camp in the service of   authoritarianism than any man has since the fellows at Hugo Boss sewed all those nifty SS uniforms. He refers to Trump  —   this will not surprise you  —   as “Daddy,”  . It is easy to imagine a generation of young men being raised without fathers and looking out the window like a kid in an   special, waiting for Daddy to come home. Many of them slip into harmless Clark Griswold —  ism, trying to provide for their own children the ideal families they themselves never had. But some of them end up grown men still staring out that window, waiting for the   figure they have spent their lives imagining, the protector and vindicator who will protect them, provide for them, and set things in order. RELATED: How   Abuse Unleashed a Heroin Epidemic, Dougherty cites the work of the conservative polemicist Sam Francis, one of those old   conservatives who very much embraced the paterfamilias model of government. His analysis, like mine, finds emotional and policy links between the Trump movement and its earlier incarnation, the Pat Buchanan movement. For Dougherty, Francis provides the philosophical link. He also provides the stylistic link: He was a kook. “Francis eventually turned into something resembling an   white nationalist,” Dougherty writes, “penning his most racist material under a pen name. Buchanan didn’t take Francis’s advice in 1996, not entirely. But 20 years later, [Francis’s book] From Household to Nation reads like a political manifesto from which the Trump campaign springs. ” From Household to Nation is typical in that it is based on a category error, asking economics to do what economics doesn’t: to provide the means “not simply to gain material satisfaction but to support families and the social institutions and identities that evolve from families as the fundamental units of human society and human action. ” Economics is about satisfying human wants, not defining them. The problem isn’t that Americans cannot sustain families, but that they do not wish to. It is therefore strange to me that Dougherty so fundamentally misdiagnoses the conservative reaction to Trump: “A Trump win,” he writes in another piece, “at least temporarily threatens the conservative movement, because it threatens to expose how inessential its ideas are to holding together the party. ” (Dougherty also equates the fundraising engaged in by conservative organizations with the Social Security fraud that sustains his fictional Mike, a characterization that indicates the emotional temperament at work here.) Of course there is careerism in the conservative movement, but to proceed as though it were impossible to imagine that conservatives oppose a man running (knowingly or not) on a Sam Francis platform because we oppose the loopy crackpot racist ideas of Sam Francis is to perform an intellectual disservice. It is also immoral. It is immoral because it perpetuates a lie: that the white working class that finds itself attracted to Trump has been victimized by outside forces. It hasn’t. The white middle class may like the idea of Trump as a giant pulsing humanoid middle finger held up in the face of the Cathedral, they may sing hymns to Trump the destroyer and whisper darkly about “globalists” and  —   odious, stupid term  —   “the Establishment,” but nobody did this to them. They failed themselves. RELATED:   Whites Have Moral Responsibilities  —   In Defense of Kevin Williamson, If you spend time in hardscrabble, white upstate New York, or eastern Kentucky, or my own native West Texas, and you take an honest look at the welfare dependency, the drug and alcohol addiction, the family anarchy  —   which is to say, the whelping of human children with all the respect and wisdom of a stray dog  —   you will come to an awful realization. It wasn’t Beijing. It wasn’t even Washington, as bad as Washington can be. It wasn’t immigrants from Mexico, excessive and problematic as our current immigration levels are. It wasn’t any of that. Nothing happened to them. There wasn’t some awful disaster. There wasn’t a war or a famine or a plague or a foreign occupation. Even the economic changes of the past few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence  —   and the incomprehensible malice  —   of poor white America. So the gypsum business in Garbutt ain’t what it used to be. There is more to life in the 21st century than wallboard and cheap sentimentality about how the Man closed the factories down. The truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap. Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals stealing our jobs. Forget your goddamned gypsum, and, if he has a problem with that, forget Ed Burke, too. The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. Donald Trump’s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin. What they need isn’t analgesics, literal or political. They need real opportunity, which means that they need real change, which means that they need  .

              " ' US Civil Rights Commission Will Observe Standing Rock\\xa0Standoff  WASHINGTON  —   The US Commission on Civil Rights will send a delegation to visit the campsite in North Dakota, where hundreds of people have gathered to protest the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The goal is to meet with tribal leaders, water protectors, as well as state and government authorities. The commission is the independent, bipartisan federal civil rights watchdog group, established by the 1957 Civil Rights Act. “That has become the seminal issue of the day when it comes to Native American rights,” commission chair Martin Castro, who will travel to Standing Rock, told BuzzFeed News. “This is to me the closest thing to what we’ve done since the time that we would go down in the 1960s to the Jim Crow South, to examine what’s going on on the ground, on an open active issue, where there is engagement between the community and the government. ” Commissioners voted in a Friday meeting to make the trip, after David Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, sent a letter inviting the commission to visit. The observers intend to travel there early next week. The commission is currently researching an update to its 2003 report, “Unmet Needs,” that examines Native American life as well as the government’s stewardship of the communities and their lands. “We cannot as a commission be looking at civil rights for Native Americans and unmet needs in Indian Country in the 21st century without now looking at what’s going on in Standing Rock,” Castro said. “Ideally we’d want to observe and meet with all parties involved, from the Army Corps of engineers to the protestor who just got hit with the water cannon,” Castro said. “Hopefully we will not only write a report about what we’ve seen, but also   with players involved to see how matters may be improved. ”The visit follows two weeks of mounting tensions at Standing Rock. On November 21, police drenched protestors with water cannons in frigid temperatures, leading to the hospitalization of at least 17 people. The Army Corps of Engineers last Friday said that it intends to close lands that include the campsite by Dec. 5. On Monday, the North Dakota governor Jack Dalrymple issued an emergency evacuation order that called on protestors to vacate campsite, citing incoming cold weather. State officials have threatened to fine people traveling to the site. US Senator Corey Booker this week called for a Department of Justice investigation into the police actions in Standing Rock. In the past, police have used tear gas, rubber bullets, and police dogs against people who have gathered at the site. At least 2, 000 veterans plan to travel to the site this weekend, in solidarity with the movement.  ',\n",
              " 'Venezuela hunts rogue helicopter attackers, Maduro foes suspicious  The Venezuelan government hunted on Wednesday for rogue policemen who attacked key installations by helicopter, but critics of President Nicolas Maduro suspected the raid may have been staged to justify repression. In extraordinary scenes over Caracas around sunset on Tuesday, the stolen helicopter fired shots at the Interior Ministry and dropped grenades on the Supreme Court, both viewed by Venezuela’s opposition as bastions of support for a dictator. Nobody was injured. Officials said special forces were seeking Oscar Perez, 36, a police pilot named as the mastermind of the raid by the helicopter that carried a banner saying ”Freedom!” In 2015, Perez   and starred in ”Death Suspended,” an action film in which he played the lead role as a government agent rescuing a kidnapped businessman. There was no sign on Wednesday of Perez, whom officials condemned as a ”psychopath” but the helicopter was found on Venezuela’s northern Caribbean coastline. ”We ask for maximum support to find this fanatic, extremist terrorist,” vice president Tareck El Aissami said. The attack exacerbated an already   political crisis in Venezuela after three months of opposition protests demanding general elections and fixes for the sinking economy. At least 76 people have died in the unrest since April, the latest a    man shot in the head near a protest in the Petare slum of Caracas, authorities said on Wednesday.  Hundreds more people have been injured and arrested in what Maduro terms an ongoing coup attempt with U. S. encouragement. The attack fed a conspiracy theory by opposition supporters that it may have been a government setup and overshadowed other drama on Tuesday, including the besieging of opposition legislators by gangs in the National Assembly. The helicopter raid also coincided with a judicial measure weakening the powers of dissident chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who has emerged as a major challenger to Maduro. ”It seems like a movie,” said Julio Borges, leader of the   legislature, of the helicopter raid. ”Some people say it is a   some that it is real . .. Yesterday was full of contradictions . .. A thousand things are happening, but I summarize it like this: a government is decaying and rotting, while a nation is fighting for dignity.”  Though Perez posted a video on social media showing himself in front of four hooded armed men and claiming to represent a coalition of security and civilian officials rising up against ”tyranny,” there was no evidence of deeper support.  ”CHEAP SHOW” The government, however, accused the policemen of links to the CIA and to Miguel Rodriguez, a former interior minister and intelligence chief under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez, who recently broke with the government. ”I’m not at all convinced by the helicopter incident,” Rodriguez told Reuters on Wednesday, saying the figures behind Perez in the video looked like dummies and expressing surprise the helicopter could fly freely and also not injure anyone. ”Conclusion: a cheap show. Who gains from this? Only Nicolas for two reasons: to give credibility to his coup d’etat talk, and to blame Rodriguez,” he added, referring to himself. Around the time of the attack, the   Supreme Court expanded the role of the state ombudsman, a human rights guarantor who is closely allied with Maduro, by giving him powers previously held only by the state prosecutor’s office.     Opposition leaders described that as an attempt to supplant chief prosecutor Ortega, who has confronted both Maduro and the Supreme Court this year after splitting ranks. The Supreme Court on Wednesday evening said it approved a measure blocking Ortega from leaving the country, freezing her bank accounts, and summoning her to a July 4 hearing to discuss whether she has committed ”serious offenses.”  Adding to Venezuela’s   atmosphere, opposition supporters again took to the streets nationwide on Wednesday to barricade roads.  One opposition lawmaker, Juan Guaido, filmed himself bleeding from wounds he said were inflicted by rubber bullets.  Opposition supporters hope that cracks within government may swing the crisis their way, and have been delighted to see heavyweights like Ortega and Rodriguez oppose Maduro. Their main focus is to stop a July 30 vote called by Maduro to form a   known as a Constituent Assembly, with powers to rewrite the constitution and supersede other institutions. Maduro says the assembly is the only way to bring peace to Venezuela, but opponents say it is a sham vote intended solely to keep an unpopular government in power.  ”We can’t let July 30 happen, we mustn’t,” said children’s health worker Rosa Toro, 52, blocking a road with friends. ”We’re being governed by criminals, traffickers and thieves,” added lawyer Matias Perez, 40, protesting with a plastic trumpet. Government officials lined up on Wednesday to condemn the helicopter attack, insisting it was the work of a few individuals and not representative of wider dissent.  Foreign Minister Samuel Moncada complained about the lack of international condemnation of the attack, saying it contrasted with the barrage of foreign criticism of the government. ”In Europe it’s now eight at night, but we’ve not had any reaction from European Union countries,” he said of a bloc that has been strongly critical of Maduro in recent months. The minister rejected accusations that the attack was carried out by the government for its own purposes.  ”Who can believe we are that sophisticated? Sending someone to throw grenades, who can believe that?” he asked.

              " 'Fruit juice isn’t much better for you than soda. Let’s stop pretending otherwise.  One of the biggest public health wins of recent decades has been America’s slow shift away from soda.    With more awareness about the very strong correlation between guzzling sweet, fizzy drinks, and obesity and tooth decay, sales of beverages like   and Pepsi have slumped. But there’s pretty good evidence that Americans are still getting hoodwinked by juices and other sugary beverages.         ”Cola” refers to both   and   cola carbonates. ”Juice” covers all packaged juices from fruits or vegetables, including 100% juice, nectars ( % juice content) juice drinks (up to 24% juice content) and   drinks (no juice content). ”Sports and energy drinks” refers to drinks that promise to boost energy levels such as  Red Bull, Monster, and RockStar.    Check out this data from Euromonitor. Its analysis of US retail beverage sales over the past five years finds that while the soda category is shrinking, juice sales have held steady, and sales of energy and sports drinks have been growing. Here’s how the market looks in terms of volume (millions of liters) sold:         This article in BMJ Open demonstrated the extent of the problem: The researchers looked at how much of the American diet is composed of   foods and added sugars. They found that 58 percent of total energy intake  —   more than half of the calories Americans consume!  —   came from foods that are packed with lots of flavors, colors, and sweeteners. And almost 90 percent of the added sugars Americans consume came from heavily processed foods  —   the two main sources being soft drinks (17 percent) closely followed by fruit drinks (14 percent). (In this case, ”fruit drinks” refers to processed juices with added sugars.) To be clear: Soda remains a big public health threat. As Marion Nestle, a New York University professor and author of the new book Soda Politics. points out, ”Sales of [soda alternatives] are up, but not nearly so much as to compensate for the decline in Coke and Pepsi.” But the data suggests that Americans are finding new ways to pack calories into their diet through other sugary drinks. We should think of juice as soda without the fizz Most juices and sports drinks have as much or even more sugar than soda, as you can see in this chart from the Harvard School of Public Health:               You might think fruit juice is inherently healthier than soda because it comes from fruit. But that’s not always the case. I asked nutrition researchers this question, and they all pointed out that the sugar in fruit juice is more concentrated than it is in whole fruits. When you drink fruit juice, you get a mega dose of sugar the same way you do when you drink soda. ”Juices have some nutritional value when the sugars are not added. But people don’t drink all that much [natural fruit] juice  —   it’s too expensive. They drink juice drinks with added sugars,” said Nestle.  These juices drinks  —   like bottled cranberry or grape juices  —   are basically sugar water with artificial flavors and little nutritional benefit. And even pure fruit juices that deliver vitamins and nutrients  —   like freshly squeezed orange juice  —   also deliver a lot of calories and sugar.  That said, nutritionists aren’t arguing you have to avoid fruit juice entirely. Real fruit juices are nutritionally superior to sodas and can be part of a healthy diet  —   albeit in moderation, Nestle said. ”Juices, like any other source of liquid sugars, are best consumed in small amounts.”  We’re starting to tax soda  —   but not juice A handful of countries are moving to tax sugary drinks in an effort to fight obesity. But in some instances, the taxes continue to focus on soda, and overlook the huge quantities of sugar people are consuming in fruit juice. In Britain, for example, the government just announced a forthcoming sugary drinks tax  —   but it only applies to soft drinks with added sugar, and excludes all   beverages and fruit juices. (See the Treasury Department’s fact sheet on the soda tax). That means beverages like milkshakes and cranberry juices won’t be taxed even though they’re nearly as damaging to health from a nutrition standpoint.    Berkeley, California, has a tax on sugary drinks, but it also excludes sweetened milk products and 100 percent juices. Soda companies in the UK are considering legal action over the tax on the basis of discrimination, since the tax excludes other sugary drinks. They raise a fair point. If the taxes focused on sugar content and calories, many more beverage companies  —   makers of chocolate milk, energy drinks, and fruit juice  —   would be affected. But as Nestle pointed out, there are political reasons that doesn’t happen. ”A tax on sweetened milk,” she said, ”will bring down the wrath of the dairy industry, which no legislator wants to take on.” Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the details of exclusions on Berkeley’s soda tax.

              " 'Sessions won’t testify at congressional budget hearings but at Senate intelligence hearing instead  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had agreed to testify this week before the Senate and House appropriations committees about the Justice Department budget, wrote the chairmen of the committees Saturday and said he was sending his deputy to testify instead.  Sessions was scheduled to testify before Congress on Tuesday for the first time since he was confirmed as attorney general in February. In light of former FBI director James B. Comey’s testimony last week, Sessions was expected to get many questions from lawmakers about his contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 election campaign. Sessions wrote to the two chairmen that he would testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday instead. A Justice Department official said that committee hearing probably will be closed to the public.  In early March, The Washington Post reported that Sessions twice met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign and did not disclose that to the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearing in January. The next day, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation and said it would be overseen by his deputy attorney general, who last month appointed a special counsel to handle the probe.  [  Sessions recuses himself from Russia investigation probe]        (Victoria   Washington Post)   Sessions also was expected to get questions about his involvement in the firing of Comey and the news that he offered his resignation to President Trump at one point recently. “I previously accepted an invitation to testify on behalf of the Department of Justice before the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees about the department’s FY18 budget, which funds the department’s efforts in several important areas such as combating the opioid crisis and violent crime,” Sessions wrote to Sen. Richard C. Shelby ( .) chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on commerce, justice, science and related agencies, and Rep. John Abney Culberson ( .) chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on commerce, justice, science and related agencies. “In light of reports regarding Mr. Comey’s recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum,” Sessions wrote. “The Senate Intelligence Committee is the most appropriate forum for such matters, as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant, classified information. ” Comey testified Thursday that the bureau had information about Sessions  —   before he recused himself from overseeing the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election  —   that would have made it “problematic” for him to be involved in the probe.  [Comey said FBI information about Sessions would have made his involvement in Russia probe problematic]  Sessions wrote the chairmen that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein will take his place before both the House and Senate subcommittees to testify about the Justice Department’s budget.  Sessions said he was “pleased to accept” the invitation to appear before members of the Senate Select Committee on Tuesday. Spokesmen for the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee could not be reached to confirm whether the hearing will be open or closed to the public.

            "Message: 20 killed in stabbings at Muslim shrine, Pakistani police say Islamabad, Pakistan  (CNN) A custodian and four other suspects have been arrested after 20 people were killed at a Muslim shrine, authorities in Pakistan said Sunday.   Three more people are hospitalized in critical condition after the attack in Punjab province, said Liaqat Chattah, deputy police commissioner for Sargodha city, where the attack happened.  Custodian Abdul Waheed drugged and stripped the victims before they were killed at the Sufi shrine, which is named the Ali Ahmad Gunnar Shrine, said Chattah.      Knives and clubs were used to attack the devotees before police were alerted by two men and two women who had fled the scene, Chattah said. Waheed was arrested, along with four other suspects. The police official described Waheed as mentally unstable.  An investigation is underway, he said.  Shrines to various saints are scattered all over Pakistan, where they are considered places of meditation and refuge, where the homeless find shelter and alms are handed out. Shrine custodians generally perform caretaker duties    keeping the area clean and managing events and rituals. Sargodha is about 105 miles northwest of Lahore. Minister orders inquiry, compensation, The chief minister of Punjab province, Shahbaz Sharif, has ordered an inquiry into the killings and announced that the victims’ families will be compensated, said an aide, Salman Sufi. ”The practices at shrines include money donations, jewelry and gifts in return (for) a pat of blessing from the custodians,” Sufi said. ”Some guardians are appointed after an inner power struggle no less than those on the lines of Cosa Nostra,” he added, referring to the Sicilian mafia. Custodians of many shrines cultivate relationships with local politicians to increase their influence and, in return for votes, receive protection, he said. ”There have been cases in which unknowns are granted the status of sainthood and their burial places declared shrines, merely for the purpose of donation collection,” Sufi said. ”Large sums of money are then collected and used on food, clothing, processions and, when an illicit custodian is involved, on drugs, women and alcohol.” He called for regulations to control shrine custodians in the country. Previous attack killed dozens, In February, at least 75 people were killed in a suicide attack at Pakistan’s Lal Shahbaz Qalandar shrine. Worshippers had gathered there for the Sufi ritual of Dhamal, which involves music, chanting and prayer.  Sufism is an mystical Islamic movement that’s been around since the 13th century. Followers of Sufism undertake distinct ritual practices, such as reciting hymns and poetry, with the aim of reaching a direct encounter with God. The Islamic State Khorasan, ISIS’ affiliate in Afghanistan and Pakistan, claimed responsibility for that attack in a phone call to CNN. \n",

            "Message: Puerto Rico’s Dream, Denied    I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Status questions are now settled for Puerto Rico and other United States territories. They will remain congressional dependencies with little to no   —  colonies, in effect —  until Congress says otherwise, allowing them to become states or become independent. This week, the Supreme Court decided a case involving Puerto Rico’s debt structure and chose whether to hear a case involving birthright citizenship in American Samoa, two final rulings in a collection of legal challenges from the territories. A ruling in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California   Trust and a denial of review for Tuaua v. United States on Monday effectively ended a budding theory of   in these areas and confirmed a federal legal view of territories that was established during the height of American imperialism. Puerto Rico Belongs to Congress, Puerto Rico’s fight was probably over last week. A Supreme Court ruling in the case Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle, which was about   protections for Puerto Ricans, established that Puerto Rico has no real authority it does not derive from Congress. The U. S. House’s easy passage of the   bill PROMESA stripped away even more of Puerto Rico’s functional   authority, establishing an independent board with no Puerto Rican oversight that can restructure Puerto Rico’s debts and set financial priorities. The Court’s ruling in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California   Trust affirmed both of these policies, clarifying that Puerto Rico cannot create its own municipal bankruptcy code and is also excluded from the normal bankruptcy protections granted to municipalities in states, leaving its only legal restructuring path with Congress. With financial ruin fast approaching for the island, it seems the only legally viable path for debt relief is an upcoming vote on PROMESA in the Senate. The Court also decided not to weigh in on Tuaua v. United States. In refusing to hear the case, the Court affirmed the ruling in the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals that automatic birthright citizenship does not apply to people born in American Samoa. American Samoans are born as U. S. nationals, not American citizens, and must be naturalized in order to vote or hold office. The D. C. court’s ruling is based on two things: the ambiguity of the Constitution’s citizenship clause with respect to unincorporated territories and outlying possessions, and the will of many American Samoans to remain a functionally separate and   people. These rulings on Puerto Rico undermine the possibility of   in any territory. The courts ruled that ultimate sovereignty and the right to govern comes from Congress and Congress alone for territories. Puerto Rico has reached the highest legal status possible for a U. S. territory —  it’s an incorporated commonwealth —  but it is still legally distinct from states, with no real   beyond what Congress allows. This is also true of territories that do not hold commonwealth status, such as American Samoa, Guam, and the U. S. Virgin Islands. People in territories will not be able to grant themselves privileges equivalent to those afforded in states —  most notably the right to vote for congressional representation —  until Congress so decides. In a recent conversation, the Puerto Rican   scholar Carlos Iván Gorrín Peralta told me that with this recent slate of court cases and legislation, the “ambiguity of 60 years is disappearing. ” He was referring to the decades since Puerto Rico was declared   and granted the ability to organize a constitution and government, actions which Puerto Rico’s lawyers used as the basis for their arguments in court. Over the past few weeks, the Supreme Court and Congress have articulated firm limits on Puerto Rico’s power, and the executive branch joined in through amicus curiae briefs. The position of the United States government with respect to its territories has never been clearer. Optimism among   activists and scholars in the territories has been subdued. Aside from presidential campaign promises and some passionate speeches during the PROMESA debate, there hasn’t been much word from Congress or the administration on just what this all means for the prospect of statehood or independence for Puerto Rico and the unincorporated territories. Both are possibilities, especially for Puerto Rico: Congress may not be eager to act as its sole, ultimate authority for long, especially facing the massive responsibility of Puerto Rico’s debt. These decisions could also lead up to independence for the territories, as the United States will probably face more pressure from the United Nations and other international bodies to allow the territories freedom if they cannot become parts of the Union proper. But the end of this series of decisions could just as easily perpetuate America’s old history of imperialism, defined by the acquisition of territory without offers of full American citizenship. Under current law, only the United States government can choose to grant these rights. Judging by the last few weeks, people seeking higher status in territories might be waiting for a long time yet.\n",

            "Message: As Hollywood Stars Can Attest, It’s Good To Be A Man On Payday To understand the economy, you have to do a lot of measuring. What’s bigger? What’s growing? What’s unequal? On national Equal Pay Day, women and economists take a hard look at incomes. And their measurements show that after decades of the   battles, men still get bigger paychecks  —   sometimes for the same work. This year, Equal Pay Day falls on April 12  —   marking the day in the new year when women finally have earned as much as men did in the previous year. A coalition of women’s groups, unions and others has been marking   day since 1996. ”Equal pay for equal work should be a fundamental principle of our economy,” President Obama said Tuesday. Statistics show the median annual income for women is roughly $40, 000  —   and just over $50, 000 for men. In other words, women make a little less than 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. If you dig around in pay data, here’s what you also see: That last point is important: Even when controlling for all measurable factors, many women still come out on the short end of the paycheck. The Sony hack in late 2014 underscored that reality, with emails showing that even Hollywood superstar Jennifer Lawrence was paid less than her male   in the same movie, American Hustle. ”[There are] certainly cases of explicit bias,” Harvard economist Claudia Goldin told NPR’s All Things Considered. But Goldin said her research also shows that in many cases, different pay levels are tied to employers’ preference for workers who can put in long hours whenever needed. Jobs with crazy hours ”are the ones that are often the   occupations,” she said. So, regardless of gender, a doctor who works steady, daytime hours makes less than a colleague who is always on call and works a ”graveyard shift,” she said. Many female employees, especially those caring for children or elderly parents, ”would like greater predictability . .. [and] fewer periods of long hours,” she said. To achieve the social goal of pay equality, private employers will have to become more accepting of a ”  balance” that doesn’t punish workers for taking care of family, she said. A study released Tuesday by the Democratic staff of Congress’ Joint Economic Committee reached a similar conclusion about the ”mommy penalty” for caregivers. ”Women are significantly more likely than men to leave a job or reduce their hours to care for children. This makes them more likely to miss out on scheduled or merit pay increases, and it negatively affects their tenure and    experience,” the report said. The report urges employers to update their ”outdated workplace policies to reflect 21st century realities.” Meanwhile, Obama was marking the day by looking back at the 20th century  —   and designating the home and headquarters of the National Woman’s Party as a national monument. The house previously had been known as the   House and Museum. In the future, it will be known as the new   Women’s Equality National Monument, named in honor of Alice Paul, a feminist who founded the National Woman’s Party, and Alva Belmont, a former president of the organization. ”[Tuesday’s] designation will permanently protect one of the oldest standing houses near the U. S. Capitol and help preserve an extensive archival collection that documents the history, strategies, tactics and accomplishments of the movement to secure women’s suffrage and equal rights in the United States and across the globe,” the White House said in a written statement.\n",

            "Message: Patriot Act debate: Everything you need to know Washington (CNN) Two years after Edward Snowden exposed the National Security Agency’s secret collection of the data of millions of Americans’ private communications, the bulk of those programs remain intact.  But the key section of the Patriot Act that the NSA used to authorize that program is set to expire on June 1. Early Saturday morning, the Senate failed to pass both a   extension of the current program, as well as a House alternative that sought to keep many of the NSA’s surveillance abilities intact. With the Senate set to take a   recess, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber will meet again on Sunday, May 31, to consider ways that would not let the program expire. As the debate roils, get up to speed on NSA surveillance, how the Patriot Act authorized it and why Congress may    or may not    reform the program. What is the Patriot Act? The law goes back to the   terrorist attacks and embodies the swift reaction of the executive and legislative branches in the wake of the deadliest terrorist strike on American soil. Within weeks of the attacks, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the bill into law, giving law enforcement and intelligence authorities unprecedented domestic authority    and the tools to wield that authority    to thwart plots against the United States. ”Surveillance of communications is another essential tool to pursue and stop terrorists,” Bush said at the law’s signing ceremony in Oct. 2001. ”The existing law was written in the era of rotary telephones. This new law that I sign today will allow surveillance of all communications used by terrorists, including emails, the Internet, and cell phones.” But it would end up doing much more    more, even, than the law’s major supporters and its primary architect on Capitol Hill, Wisconsin Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, ever imagined possible. So that part about cell phones. That’s how the NSA started collecting phone records on millions of Americans? Yes, but the Patriot Act wasn’t actually used for the justification for bulk metadata collection until 2006. That practice began secretly in 2001 after Bush used his executive authority to give the NSA the green light to begin sweeping phone and Internet records after  . The Bush administration would eventually use the Patriot Act to justify its program    enshrining it in law. Hold up. What the heck is this metadata, anyway? Metadata is all the information surrounding a call, including the caller’s number, the receiver’s number, the time and location of the call, and how long it lasted    basically, everything except for the audio of the call itself. And the NSA collects the metadata of millions of Americans without those citizens’ knowledge and without a warrant specifically targeting individuals suspected of wrongdoing.  OK, but how much can the NSA actually learn without listening in to the call? The NSA can actually piece together quite a bit about a person by analyzing phone metadata     information that a surveillance target’s family might not even know. Repeated calls to a cardiologist could suggest a heart condition. Repeated late night calls between two employees could suggest a romantic relationship. ”They can know, for example, whether an American called a psychiatrist three times in 36 hours, twice after midnight. That is a lot private information,” explained Sen. Ron Wyden,   a leading supporter of NSA reforms. And while NSA agents likely aren’t spending their days poring over the metadata of Americans who aren’t suspected of any terrorist activity, the agency does store the data for five years and retains easy access to the trove of information. So what in the Patriot Act authorizes the NSA to rake in that information? The government can petition the FISA court    a secret court spawned out of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act    for a warrant to collect ”any tangible things” to investigate terrorism or foreign spies. READ: Leading the secret FISA court: QA with Judge Reggie Walton, If the government can credibly show that to the court’s 11 judges, it gets a secret warrant that can force companies, such as Verizon, to hand over private information. And the recipient of the warrant is barred from discussing the warrant with anyone, due to national security concerns. The Patriot Act stresses that the government can only request a warrant to obtain information that is ”relevant to an ongoing investigation against international terrorism.” How is the data of millions of Americans ”relevant” to terrorism investigations? The Bush administration argued in 2006 that the metadata analysis program could only be successful if the government could collect and store the data of millions of Americans, even though it conceded ”the vast majority of (data collected) will not be  .” ”Although admittedly a substantial portion of the telephony metadata that is collected would not relate to operatives of (redacted) the intelligence tool that the government hopes to use to find (redacted) communications    metadata analysis    requires collecting and storing large volumes of the metadata to enable later analysis. All of the metadata collected is thus relevant, because the success of this investigative tool depends on bulk collection,” the administration argued. That argument served as the justification for subsequent FISA court decisions approving warrants to collect customer data from various phone companies    warrants that need to be renewed every 60 or 90 days. READ: Rand Paul seizes political moment with NSA protest, But now Section 215 of the Patriot Act could be going away? And this program would change? That’s right. But lawmakers who want changes to the program still have a tough slog ahead of them. Sensenbrenner, the lead author of the Patriot Act, was quick to condemn the FISA court’s interpretation of the law once Snowden revealed the extent of the dragnet surveillance, calling the practice ”based on a blatant misreading of the law.” He and Sen. Patrick Leahy,   have since led the charge to reform the Patriot Act and their efforts have gained steam in recent months, with the USA Freedom Act overwhelmingly passing the House earlier this month in a   vote. The reform bill would keep the government from collecting telephone metadata of millions of Americans, instead requiring the NSA to get a warrant from the FISA court to collect data on a specific individual from telecommunications companies. But the law is facing stiff opposition in the Senate from some of that chamber’s most powerful Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,   and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, who want to reauthorize the Patriot Act for five years without any reforms. And if the Senate can’t reach an agreement to extend the Patriot Act in some way, chunks of the law would sunset on June 1. If the Senate doesn’t get its act together, what happens? Section 215, which authorizes the bulk metadata collection program, would sunset. But two other sections of the Patriot Act would also expire: a   ”lone wolf” provision and another section that allows roving wiretaps. The first allows law enforcement to use the national security apparatus to go after suspected terrorists who may not be affiliated with a terrorist group, but share terrorist ideology and aims. That’s a particular concern for law enforcement officials today as terrorist groups like ISIS are using social media to inspire individuals to carry out attacks in the U. S. and Europe. The FBI would also lose the ability to apply for new roving wiretaps to pursue suspected terrorists, a common procedure used in other criminal investigations that allows officials to wiretap additional phones linked to a suspect without requesting a new warrant. Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, a CNN analyst, said losing that authority would be a ”severe” blow to counterterrorism efforts, keeping the FBI from collecting the information it needs in a timely manner. But counterterrorism officials already conducting investigations wouldn’t be completely hamstrung. A provision in the Patriot Act would allow officials to use these tools in investigations that were started before the June 1 sunset date. Why are some lawmakers so opposed to reforming the Patriot Act? For opponents of reform, it’s all about national security. They cite the growing terror threats the U. S. is facing, as ISIS continues to grow in Syria and Iraq and expands its reach online, inspiring attacks in Europe and the U. S. To throw away a key tool at a time of such heightened concern would be foolish, opponents say. ”For somebody to just say we’re willing to let the Patriot Act expire is irresponsible,” Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, told CNN. McCain and others argue that the U. S. could have prevented   if the NSA programs had been in place before the terror attacks. And fellow Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina insisted that the NSA programs authorized under the Patriot Act are ”still our best bet to prevent another  .” ”It’s one thing to reform the Patriot Act,” Graham said. ”It’s another thing to gut it or weaken it.” The Republican opponents of reform are toeing the line set out by Burr, the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. Several Republican lawmakers    including Graham and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina    cited Burr as their ideological guide on the Patriot Act and NSA surveillance. ”When Richard Burr tells me it goes too far, I think about that,” Graham told CNN. ”I trust his judgment.” Terrorism is deadly serious. Why do some lawmakers want us to restrict any of our   capabilities? Reformers insist their opponents are   when there’s actually little to fear from reforming domestic surveillance. The government hasn’t been able to provide any examples where the NSA’s bulk data collection played a key role in thwarting a terror plot. And multiple reviews of the program by groups and individuals with access to classified information have concluded the program isn’t as much of a boon to national security as the staunchest defenders of the program suggest. A presidential review group convened to review NSA surveillance in the wake of the Snowden revelations concluded ”the information contributed to terrorist investigations by the use of Section 215 telephony   was not essential to preventing attacks and could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional Section 215 orders.” Put another way, the NSA doesn’t need to pull telephone metadata on millions of Americans to protect U. S. national security    it should just petition the FISA court for access to data of suspected terrorists. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent agency within the executive branch, also couldn’t find ”a single instance involving a threat to the U. S. in which the telephone records program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation.” Richard Clarke, a former senior White House counterterrorism adviser to Republican and Democratic presidents who served on Obama’s NSA review group, said ”there’s no way that you can claim that there’s a single terrorist act that was prevented because of the telephony metadata collection program.” ”There are always going to be politicians who take positions that are not   but are based more on emotion and political positioning,” Clarke said. ”There are always going to be politicians who are going to position themselves as more opposed to terrorism than anybody else. But their positions are not analytically derived or  .” How are supporters of reform pushing back against national security concerns? Let’s leave it to their own words. Here are several   lawmakers who sat down for interviews with CNN. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte,   was one several top congressmen to meet with House Republican leadership to craft a compromise version of the USA Freedom Act that could pass the House. ”I think most Americans believe    and I certainly do    that you can have a very high level of protection of civil liberties and a very high level of national security. In fact, we believe this bill strengthens both,” he said. He noted that the bill would strengthen some provisions of the Patriot Act, ensuring, for example, that there is no lapse in surveillance between different agencies when a potential terrorist enters the U. S. and the FBI takes over    without needing new authorization from the FISA court. Sen. Mike Lee, the Republican from Utah who is sponsoring the USA Freedom Act in his chamber, is leaning his arguments on constitutional concerns and trust in government as he looks to sway conservatives. ”The USA Freedom Act does not propose that we abandon any and all efforts to analyze telephone data,” Lee said. ”What we’re talking about here is a program that currently contemplates the collection of all data just as a routine matter and the aggregation of all that data in one database. That causes concerns for a lot of people. .. There’s a lot of potential for abuse.” Reformers also point out that the FISA court is creating a body of what they call ”secret law.” The USA Freedom Act would require major FISA court decisions    like the one that authorized bulk data collection    be declassified.\n",

            "Message: The biggest cause of death in your county  (CNN) Deaths due to heart problems tend to be highest in counties along the southern half of the Mississippi River.  Violent deaths tend to be common in Western counties, and deaths from mental and substance abuse disorders tend to be more common in Kentucky and West Virginia counties than others. Those are just a few of the trends that emerged in a new study that revealed the major causes of death for counties across the United States. The study was published in the journal JAMA on Tuesday. ”We know that unequal access and quality of care create health disparities in the US for many causes of death, while other causes are linked to risk factors or policies. The results of this study prompt future research to further identify what drives health disparities in our country,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, a professor and director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who was a   of the new study. Death by the numbers, For the study, researchers analyzed death records from the National Center for Health Statistics’ National Vital Statistics System. The records included data on 80, 412, 524 deaths that occurred from 1980 through 2014 in the United States. The data included the county of residence for each person who died, at the time of their death, but did not include data on deaths of Americans outside the United States. After taking a close look at which causes of deaths occurred in which counties, the researchers found trends in how many deaths were due to tumors cardiovascular disease diabetes and diseases that affect the urinary tract, genitals, blood, thyroid or pancreas neurological disorders suicide and violence chronic respiratory diseases   injuries mental and substance disorders chronic liver diseases and infectious diseases. The 2014 mortality rates and geographic patterns in the data are a good indicator of current trends, Murray said. The findings appear to be the most comprehensive yet to describe how a broad set of causes of death differ across counties, said Ellen Meara, a professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in New Hampshire, who was not involved in the new study. ”It is unique in its ability to track   death rates in small areas over a long time period, three decades,” Meara said of the study. Regions with highest cancer,   deaths, The study showed very high mortality rates due to tumors, especially when cancerous, in counties along the southern half of the Mississippi River, eastern Kentucky, western West Virginia and western Alaska.  However, many counties in states stretching from Idaho and Wyoming in the north to western Texas in the south had    mortality rates from tumors, according to the results. Cancer death rates between 2009 and 2013 were highest in Union County, Florida Wade Hampton Census Area, Alaska Woodson County, Kansas Powell County, Kentucky and other nearby counties, according to separate statistics from the National Cancer Institute’s state cancer profiles.   For cardiovascular disease, mortality rates decreased by about 50% overall between 1980 and 2014, but the rate of decline varied by county, according to the study. Slow rates of improvement were observed in Southern counties stretching from Oklahoma to Alabama and Kentucky. Cardiovascular disease death rates were highest among Franklin, Louisiana Caldwell, Louisiana Gallatin, Kentucky and other nearby counties from 2012 to 2014, according to separate data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke Tables. Heart disease has consistently been the leading cause of death in the United States in recent years, with cancer as a close second, according to data released by the National Vital Statistics System in August (PDF). The new study also showed that mortality rates due to diabetes and diseases that affect the urinary tract, genitals, blood, thyroid or pancreas were particularly high in counties in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi along the Mississippi River and in counties with Native American reservations in North Dakota and South Dakota. Large increases in deaths due to neurological disorders were observed in Southern counties stretching from eastern Texas and Oklahoma to Alabama, according to the study. Declines in mortality were found in counties in the West, an area reaching from central Idaho and western Montana to central Colorado.  Do you live in the county with highest drug deaths? Increased mortality rates due to chronic respiratory diseases were observed in a prominent cluster of counties in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia and in a second cluster in southeastern Colorado, according to the new study.  The lowest mortality rates were found in counties in the District of Columbia area, the upper Midwest, southern Florida, southern Texas and central Colorado.  Chronic respiratory diseases are often linked to smoking. Other risk factors include air pollution, exposure to chemicals and dusts, and frequent lower respiratory infections in childhood.  For deaths due to mental and substance use disorders, the mortality rate increased by 188% overall between 1980 and 2014, according to the new study.  Several clusters of counties in Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, western Pennsylvania and   Missouri saw mortality rates rise by more than 1, 000%.  According to a separate Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report released by the CDC in January, West Virginia topped the list of states with the highest rates of drug overdose deaths in the country in 2014, followed by New Mexico, New Hampshire, Kentucky and Ohio. The new study showed that counties in eastern Arizona, New Mexico and south and western Texas were among those with the highest mortality rates for cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, whereas counties in eastern South Dakota, Kansas, Iowa and southern Minnesota had the lowest mortality rates. Alcohol abuse has been linked to such liver diseases. For diarrhea, lower respiratory and other common infectious diseases, mortality rates were highest in counties in Southern states, from Louisiana and Arkansas to Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky, according to the new study.  Meanwhile, rates were lower than average in counties in southern Florida, New England, the upper Midwest, central Colorado and the Pacific Northwest.  Where   violence are highest, The highest mortality rates due to   and interpersonal violence were observed in counties in Alaska, in Native American reservations in North Dakota and South Dakota, and in states in the Southwest, according to the new study. Lower rates were found in counties in the upper Midwest, New England, southwestern Texas and southern California.  Additionally, ”about half of US counties saw increases in suicide and violence, while the other half of counties experienced decreases,” Murray said. ”Kusilvak Census Area in Alaska topped the list with a 131% mortality rate increase, while the rate in New York County, New York (which encompasses Manhattan) dropped by 72%    the most dramatic decrease in the country.” In 2012, Wyoming was the state with the highest suicide rate, followed by Alaska, Montana, New Mexico and Utah, according to a 2014 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The county with highest fatal accident rate, For deaths due to   injuries, in general, lower mortality rates were found in more urban counties, and higher mortality rates were found in more rural counties. Todd County, South Dakota, had the highest mortality rate from   injuries in 2014, and the county with the lowest mortality rate was New York County, Murray said. ”An interesting finding when deaths are mapped by small areas is the way some causes of death follow state boundaries, which suggests that state policies likely play a role in saving lives,” said Meara, the Dartmouth Institute professor. ”Deaths due to transport injuries, for example, look very different north of the Ohio River, in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, compared with Kentucky,” she said. ”You can see some of these    patterns in the maps of deaths due to   and interpersonal violence, as well.” Disturbing disparities in rural, urban counties, The 2016 County Health Rankings, a separate report conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute in March, also showed dramatic differences in health and deaths between rural and urban communities. It revealed that rural counties tended to have higher rates of smoking, obesity, child poverty and teen births, as well as higher numbers of uninsured adults, than their urban counterparts. Additionally, similar to the new study, the County Health Rankings report showed that the average rate of drug overdose deaths appeared higher in rural counties. Meara said that such   research remains important. ”This research demonstrates that the tools needed to improve health and survival in places like eastern Kentucky, where mortality from chronic respiratory disease is high and rising, differ from the tools needed to address mortality in New Mexico and western Texas, where deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver disease are high and rising,” Meara said.   ”The typical studies of   mortality mask these differences, leading to    all policies that may not be effective. With studies like these, everyone, from clinicians to local and state   can better address the needs of their communities,” she said. Although the new study does not offer a definitive conclusion for some big questions, Meara said, ”it opens up a new set of important questions about why areas experienced such different trends in particular causes of death. It provides an opportunity to learn from success and failure in different counties.” Overall, life expectancy in the United States has dropped by 0. 1 year from last year, according to data released this month from the CDC. Americans can now expect to live 78. 8 years.  Murray said he hopes to further examine trends and details in causes of death across the country to help improve public health in communities nationwide. ”State and county health departments could use   data to identify pressing local needs and tailor their policies appropriately. Physicians could use the estimates to better understand the health concerns of the populations they serve,” Murray said.  ”Researchers could identify counties that have done especially well or poor with regard to certain causes of death, warranting additional study to identify factors driving trends. Communities can use these estimates to understand the health needs of their community and advocate for change,” he said. ”These results could also provide a mechanism for evaluating the effect of certain policies and programs.”\n",

            "Message: Countering Islamist Terror Requires a Strategy, Not Denial On Saturday evening, a bomb packed with metal shrapnel exploded in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea, injuring 29 people, eleven hours after an explosion in Seaside Park, N. J. along the route of a planned Marine Corps charity run. Both bombings  —   and at least two other attempts, one in Manhattan and one in Elizabeth, N. J.  —   appear to be the work of Ahmad Khan Rahami, a    naturalized citizen from Afghanistan. The sequence of events, culminating in Rahami’s capture on Monday morning, has coincided with liberal attempts to make the weekend’s   anything other than what they obviously are: Islamic terrorism. On Saturday night, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio called the bombing “an intentional act,” making his own contribution to the roll of   euphemisms (cf. “  disaster” and “workplace violence”) while on Monday, news that Rahami may not have acted alone prompted a CNN terrorism expert (we use that word advisedly) to propose that “two or three lone wolves may have gotten together. ” Liberals refuse to acknowledge that the United States faces a deadly threat grounded in a distinct ideology. Terrorism is not an expression of frustration at a lack of economic opportunity Ahmad Rahami was not “acting out” because he couldn’t score a position at the GAP. Terrorism is violence intended to subvert the existing political order, and, in the case of people such as Rahami, to replace it with the political framework required by supremacist Islam. Acknowledging this fact does not require condemning Islam as such it simply requires acknowledging that there is a strain of Islam, with broad appeal today, that opposes the American way of life. Our policymaking should be designed around this recognition. Instead, liberal leaders have been hampering counterterror efforts. The Obama administration, incapable of uttering the phrase “Islamic terror,” has drawn down our intelligence efforts at home and abroad, while smearing police departments across the country as racist. Meanwhile, in New York City, Mayor de Blasio caved to the demands of Islamist activists earlier this year and ordered the NYPD to stop using a report that helped officers identify individuals who might be considering terrorism. Far from encouraging profiling of Muslims, the report helped investigators make the distinctions that are crucial to preempting acts of terror. That no one was killed in any of this weekend’s attacks is a minor miracle. But the adherents of Islamism are many, and dedicated, and they’ll try again. It’s long past time for a coherent, coordinated, aggressive strategy to root them out before they can do so. \n",

His victory comes as the Republican party continues to a battle from within for the nomination, but Cruz urged GOP voters to back his campaign. “We’ve got the full spectrum of the Republican Party coming together and uniting behidn this campaign. ” The victory is expected to be a particularly significant one for Cruz, who took all of the 42 delegates from Wisconsin, which is a    state for the GOP.  It is also seen as an important win for Sanders as the candidate looks to pick up momentum as the New York primary nears, a state with 291 delegates at stake and Hillary Clinton’s   home state.  With 31% of precincts reporting, Cruz was leading the Republican race with 52. 6% of the vote. Trump was in second place with 30. 6% and John Kasich with 14. 6%. On the Democratic side, Sanders was leading Clinton 53. 5 to 46. 2%. Mike Hass, the board’s spokesman, told the Associated Press that clerks across the state faced a busy pace of voters throughout the day, but no major problems were reported at the polls.  Wait times in Milwaukee, the state’s biggest city, did not exceed 30 minutes, Neil Albrecht, executive director of the Milwaukee election commission told AP. On the Republican side, more than 9 in 10 primary voters said they were very or somewhat worried with the direction of the nation’s economy, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks.  Democratic voters also cited economic concerns, with nearly   saying they were worried about the direction of the country’s economy.  The exit polls also suggest a large swath of people casting ballots Tuesday were late deciders, with about four out of 10 making up their minds in the last month. Wisconsin is expected to be a tight race for both the Democratic and Republican candidates, with nearly half of GOP voters saying they wanted someone with experience.  As to which Republican is believed to have the best shot to beat the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, more than 4 in 10 believed Cruz has the best chance. About a third said Trump has the best shot. Despite Trump’s lead in the GOP field, about four in 10 Republican voters said they were “scared” of what the Republican frontrunner would do in the White House. Only about 1 in 10 voters said they were afraid of a Kasich or Cruz presidency.  GOP voters also appeared split as to what should happen if Trump is unable to muster the needed delegates to win the nomination outright. More than half of voters in the Badger State believe the one with the most votes should get the nomination, while four in 10 would favor a contested convention. Speaking to Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes, Republican Ted Cruz noted the importance of Tuesday’s election, not just for the 42 GOP delegates at stake, but for what it could mean in the party’s primary in the states ahead.  “Wisconsin has a national platform and megaphone, and if we end up with a win tonight it’s going to have national repercussions,” the Texas senator said. “I think it’s going to impact the state’s to come. ” Cruz pointed to his recent victories against delegate frontrunner Donald Trump, including his 69% popular vote victory in Utah, and called for Republican rival John Kasich to drop out of the race, saying he had “mathematically” already lost the race.  Polls have shown Cruz with a slight lead over Trump in Wisconsin, and the Manhattan billionaire made a final pitch to voters at a diner and polling station.  “We’re going to have a surprise tonight,” Trump told reporters. “I think we’re going to have a great day. I’ve worked hard in Wisconsin. ” The race could also have significant repercussions on the democratic side. NBC News reported Bernie Sanders’ campaign has outspent Hillary Clinton’s camp by nearly   . Polls show the two    in the Badger State. MIAMI  —   Let’s get this out of the way. Donald Trump is toxic with most Latino voters. A new   Times poll found that in California he has 9% favorable and 87% unfavorable ratings, the worst in a long series of historically terrible polls. Still  —   even a low percentage of Latino voters would mean a couple million Hispanic supporters. And an observer of this divisive election cycle might ask: who are these people? One answer, found in public polling, in interviews at polling places in Nevada and Florida, and in conversations with   Trump supporters on Facebook, appears to be that they’re the types of people otherwise disposed to like Donald Trump. Older men former members of the military people enraged by the power of the establishment American nationalists. Another answer reflects the diversity within the term “Latino”: Some of Trump’s supporters’ families have been American citizens for centuries, don’t know any undocumented immigrants, or don’t identify with newcomers from Mexico and elsewhere  —   all reasons that contribute to why they embrace his immigration stances. One thing they all have in common, though, is a thick skin. Read more here.  \n",

            "Message: Facebook Blocks Ad Blockers, but It Strives to Make Ads More Relevant  SAN FRANCISCO  —   Digital ads pop up online so frequently and ubiquitously that many people are using software to block them. But if you try to stop ads from showing up on Facebook’s desktop website, you will now be out of luck: The social network has found a way to block the ad blockers. On Tuesday, Facebook flipped a switch on its desktop website that essentially renders all ad blockers  —   the programs that prevent websites from displaying ads on the page when a user visits the site  —   useless. The change allows the Silicon Valley company to serve ads on its desktop site even to people who have   software installed and running. “Disruptive ads are an industry problem, and the rise of ad blockers is a strong signal that people just don’t want to see them,” Andrew Bosworth, vice president for Facebook’s ads and business platform, said in an interview. “But ad blockers are a really bad solution to that. ” Facebook’s move is set to add to a furious debate about the ethics of ad blocking. On one hand, many digital ads are a nuisance  —   they slow loading times of web pages and detract from the online experience. Yet the ads also serve as the business foundation for many digital publishers to provide content to readers. Ad blockers have become a threat to publishers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which are facing declining advertising revenue. About 200 million people worldwide use   software on their desktop computers, according to estimates from PageFair, an     . An additional 420 million use ad blockers on their smartphones, the company said. Several digital publishers, including Wired, Forbes and The Times, have begun experimenting with    techniques, including asking visitors who use ad blockers to “whitelist” their sites so that ads may still appear. “We need to spell this out clearly to our users. The journalism they enjoy costs real money and needs to be paid for,” Mark Thompson, president and chief executive of The Times, said at an ad industry conference in June where he addressed ad blocking. “Advertising is a vital part of the revenue mix. ” Mr. Bosworth of Facebook said ad blockers were “certainly bad for the publications who are robbed of half of the value exchange between users and publishers. ” But rather than blocking all ads, he said, Facebook needed to find a way to serve better ads. Facebook’s move is perhaps the strongest    measure taken by a major technology company, especially one that serves advertising to more than 1. 7 billion monthly users globally. The effort is risky for the company, which prides itself on delivering the best user experience, because it could alienate some people for whom ad blocking is an ideological stance on how they wish to gain access to the internet. To shut down the blockers, Facebook is taking aim at the signifiers in digital ads that blockers use to detect whether something is an ad. Facebook’s desktop sitewide changes will then make ad content indistinguishable from   content. For blockers to get around these changes, Facebook said they would have to begin analyzing the content of the ads themselves, a costly and laborious process. Still, Facebook will continue to let people have some control over the ads they do and do not see. On Tuesday, the company also introduced an overhauled version of its ad preferences tool, which lets people opt out of seeing certain types of ads on the site. That will help Facebook serve more relevant ads, rather than bombard people with ads they do not want. “We want people to help us do a better job with ads, rather than to fundamentally alter the way the service is rendered,” Mr. Bosworth said. The move against ad blockers on the desktop site will not affect blockers used to access Facebook on a mobile web browser, the company said. It will also not apply to Facebook’s mobile apps, which already include advertising that cannot be blocked by outside programs. Facebook did not announce plans to expand the changes to mobile browsers in the future. Executives in the   industry denounced Facebook’s decision, calling it a misguided waste of time that would harm the social network’s members. “It takes a dark path against user choice,” Ben Williams, communications and operations manager at Eyeo G. m. b. H. the company behind AdBlock Plus, wrote in a blog post after Facebook announced the change. The move also stoked the ire of those who support ad blockers because of their ability to prevent the use of tracking software, which is often employed to monitor users’ browsing habits across the web without their knowledge or express consent. But the advertising industry welcomed the change. “Facebook should be applauded for its leadership on preserving a vibrant value exchange with its users,” Randall Rothenberg, president and chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, said in a statement. “For hundreds of years, advertising and marketing have been central to the delivery of entertainment and services that are otherwise free to consumers. ” For Facebook, which is a member of the I. A. B. advertising forms the core of its business. The company generated $3. 69 billion in profit on $17. 93 billion in revenue in 2015, a majority of which came from paid advertising. In its most recent quarter, Facebook said mobile ads produced 84 percent of ad revenue. One of Facebook’s biggest advertisers recently called into question the effectiveness of some of the company’s ads. On Tuesday, Procter  Gamble told The Wall Street Journal it was scaling back on hypertargeted ad campaigns on the social network. A P. G. spokeswoman said the company would not be spending less money on overall Facebook ads. “Facebook has a history of going out of their way to keep advertisers happy,” said Ian Schafer, founder and chief executive of Deep Focus, an ad agency. “This plays into what advertisers demand in terms of accountability for publishers. ” Others said that Facebook was striking a middle ground by stopping ad blockers but still giving people some options over what ads they would see. “Many users rely on ad blockers because they are concerned about privacy or malware,” said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry think tank that is funded in part by tech companies, including Facebook. “Facebook’s change lets users continue to use ad blockers to protect themselves, while ensuring ads are displayed. ”\n",

            "Message: Kraft backs out of Unilever bid after hostile reception  Kraft Heinz Co’s ( ) rapid retreat from its surprise $143 billion bid for Unilever ( ) ( ) in the face of stiff resistance knocked the   company’s shares on Monday as investors assessed the impact of the failed approach. Kraft, which is backed by Warren Buffett and the private equity firm 3G, wanted to buy Unilever as part of its strategy to become a global consumer goods giant by buying competitors and cutting costs and jobs to drive profits. However, the U. S. food group had not factored in Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman dismissing its offer as having no financial or strategic merit and refusing to come to the table. The vehemence of this response, along with fears of a political backlash, was enough to put off   old Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway ( ) has a   aversion to making hostile bids, sources told Reuters.   ”Kraft didn’t realize how hostile their approach would be perceived,” one source said.      A source close to Kraft said its officials alerted Britain’s Business Secretary Greg Clark in a brief call on Friday soon after it made its approach public. Kraft laid out its plan to create a consumer goods behemoth with headquarters in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands and promised to keep Downing Street informed on any developments. For Kraft, Britain’s response was a major concern after Prime Minister Theresa May signaled she would take a more proactive approach to foreign takeovers, sources told Reuters. May, who had previously singled out Kraft’s 2010 acquisition of another British household name, Cadbury Plc, as an example of a deal that should have been blocked, had indicated her government would want to examine the deal if it went ahead, according to a person familiar with the situation.  However, a spokesman for May said on Monday the government had not been involved in Kraft’s decision to pull its proposal. ”The issue of the withdrawal from the Unilever deal by Kraft is an issue you should put to Kraft. Number 10 wasn’t involved in it,” the spokesman told reporters. ”The simple fact is that the bid has been withdrawn so I don’t have a view on a bid that doesn’t exist.” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who used to work at Unilever, had also said he would examine what it would mean for the Netherlands in the ”positive and the negative” sense. CONFIDENT BET Buffett and 3G Capital’s Jorge Paulo Lemann, which together own almost 51 percent of Kraft, had hoped Unilever would be more receptive to its overture, given their success backing brewer   InBev on its 79 billion pound takeover of   SABMiller last year.  The SABMiller deal    which ranked as the consumer industry’s   merger and the   takeover of a UK listed company     had given Buffett and Lemann the confidence to pursue a bigger and riskier bet, one source said. Unilever’s   shares, which jumped 13 percent to a record high when the bid was made public on Friday, fell 8 percent to give it a market value of 100 billion pounds after Kraft said in a statement on Sunday it had ”amicably agreed” to withdraw its proposal. The company’s Dutch listed shares were down 7 percent and     analysts at Macquarie said Unilever’s stock should not give up all its gains following the approach, although some shareholders thought that another deal was unlikely. ”Unilever’s share price is still performing remarkably well as I suppose the argument that these stocks were cheap versus borrowing costs is still valid,” a shareholder with one of the biggest 20 holdings in Unilever stock told Reuters. ”A takeover at a later stage seems unlikely to me as Unilever will build their defense and sharpen their focus on profitability,” the shareholder added. CULTURE CLASH A combination of the two firms would have been the largest acquisition of a   company, Thomson Reuters data showed and would have brought together some of the world’s best known brands, from toothpaste to ice creams. While it would also have combined Kraft’s strength in the United States with Unilever’s in Europe and Asia, it would also have faced a potentially huge cultural clash. In 2013, 3G, which made its name in corporate America by orchestrating large   acquisitions and then slashing costs, teamed up with billionaire investor Buffett to acquire Heinz and then bought Kraft two years later.  Unilever feared that a merger with Kraft risked eroding the value of its brands and could impede its expansion in emerging markets, which requires more investment, people familiar with the company’s thinking said. ”It was always going to be a difficult pitch to convince shareholders to relinquish their grip on Unilever, given the expectations for the company to keep churning out resilient growth in the years to come,” George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.   (Additional reporting by Anthony Deutsch in Amsterdam, Simon Jessop, Maiya Keidan and Anjuli Davies in London; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Alexander Smith) Embattled Australian internet company Vocus Group Ltd said it will open its books for KKR & Co LP to conduct due diligence, a sign it may accept a $1. 66 billion buyout approach dismissed by investors weeks earlier as too low.

            "Message: Millions Of Voters Are Sending A Message: Our Economic Framework Is Rotten  If you don’t hang out with lawmakers, economists and journalists in Washington, you probably think Democrats and Republicans disagree on economic policy. They don’t. In Washington, there’s actually a broad consensus about economic growth. These ideas have held sway for decades: Of course, Democrats and Republicans disagree on the details, but the framework has remained solid regardless of who holds power in the White House or Congress. That’s why President Obama, a Democrat, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, both support the   Partnership, a trade deal. It’s why Obama says that ”generations of immigrants have made this country into what it is,” and Ryan says that ”immigrants contribute to our economy.” It’s why Democrat Nancy Pelosi says that ”it is imperative that America continues to lead the world through innovation,” and Republican Mitch McConnell says that ”the Internet and the rapid adoption of mobile technology have been great American success stories.” Now, Washington’s cozy cocoon of ideas is getting a violent shaking from Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Trump, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, and Sanders who is seeking the Democratic nomination, are very different candidates. One is a billionaire businessman, and the other a democratic socialist. But each is appealing to voters who believe that Washington’s economic framework is rotten. The candidates want to tear it down, and millions of   Americans agree. The people who helped build that framework are taking note. ”While the U. S. economy is performing well, the electorate remains unconvinced, even angry over how the economy has not performed for them, and their anger is stirred by presidential candidates in both parties,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a written assessment Thursday. To understand what’s been happening this presidential primary season, consider Michigan, where voters turned out in huge numbers for Sanders and Trump. According to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, the   annual median household income in Michigan fell by about $14, 000 a year  —   down to about $52, 000  —   from 1999 to 2014. That same time period played out very differently for corporations. From 1999 to 2014, U. S. annual corporate profits after taxes shot up by about 250 percent, to nearly $1. 7 trillion. So, yes, businesses did much better, allowing Washington   to, in effect, say: ”See, we were right! We promoted the ideas that have kept America’s GDP ranked No. 1 in the world, even though China has four times our population.” But outside of Washington, millions of Americans are not living in a Big Picture or a Framework. They are living in houses that have lost value, in cities where they don’t trust the water pipes and where companies can suddenly announce they are moving jobs to other countries. With their support of Sanders and Trump, those workers have made it clear they want a new paradigm. Trump talks about building a wall to stop immigrants Sanders talks about breaking up big banks. So their solutions are quite different, but the message is the same: No more business as usual. Many economists say the alternatives would only be worse. They point to Argentina  —   it was one of the world’s richest nations a century ago. Then it fell behind in technological innovation and education, became politically chaotic and declined dramatically. The only way to improve the lives of average Americans is to encourage them to fit themselves into a technologically advanced,   intensely competitive global economy. But other economists are saying Washington does need to rethink its assumptions. Andrew Levin is a Dartmouth economics professor who spent many years in Washington as an economist for the Federal Reserve and for the International Monetary Fund. He said that for decades, economists have been basing their ideas on formulas that showed the free flows of goods, capital and people would maximize wealth. But these days, many are ”recognizing that our models are too simple . .. life is more complex,” Levin said. In other words, economists were right to say more trade could boost wealth, but wrong to assume it would help most workers. As wages have stagnated, ”confidence in the Washington consensus has very much faded over the past 10 years,” Levin said. So should the Washington consensus change? Yes, ”but you don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” Levin warned. For example, he said, it would be a big mistake to shut off all trade or return to an obsolete gold standard. Instead, he recommends that economic and policy leaders take smaller steps while   the data. For example, they could decide that ”trade agreements should ensure that the benefits are shared more evenly with American families,” he said.\n",

            "Message: Donald Trump Is Said to Intend to Keep a Stake in His Business    Donald J. Trump is considering formally turning over the operational responsibility for his real estate company to his two adult sons, but he intends to keep a stake in the business and resist calls to divest, according to several people briefed on the discussions. Under a plan now being considered by the Trump family and its lawyers, Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump’s elder daughter, would also take a leave of absence from the Trump Organization, in the surest sign that she is exploring a potential move to Washington with her husband, Jared Kushner. Mr. Kushner is discussing an   undetermined role advising his    and Ms. Trump plans on being an advocate on issues in which she has a personal interest, like child care. Before deciding how to separate from her father’s business, Ms. Trump is also assessing how to disentangle from her apparel and licensing brands, which are named for her, two people briefed on her plans said. She plans on appointing a president of her company to run the    operations. The Trumps are exploring what was described by one person briefed on the discussions as a “legal structure” that would give Mr. Trump and his daughter separation from the company. The New York Times spoke to two people involved in the transition process who were granted anonymity to speak candidly about continuing negotiations. None of the plans have been completed, and it remains uncertain precisely what the   will reveal next week at an expected news conference at which he has said he will discuss “leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country. ” Aides to Ms. Trump and to Mr. Trump’s transition team declined to comment. In announcing on Twitter last week that he would hold a news conference, Mr. Trump acknowledged that leaving his business was “visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses. ” Still, the Trump family is facing enormous external pressure to do as much as it can to ensure a bright line between the  ’s business brand and his role leading the country. And any arrangement in which Mr. Trump derives a financial interest in his business could add to criticism about potential conflicts that could arise from the Trump Organization’s global ties. The Office of Government Ethics has told Mr. Trump’s lawyers that only a divestiture would resolve ethical concerns, guidance that was made public in an extraordinary stream of posts on the office’s Twitter feed. Officials with the office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the plan under consideration. The federal law that prevents federal employees from making decisions involving their financial interests exempts the president and vice president, though no recent sitting president has maintained foreign financial holdings as extensive as Mr. Trump’s. At a meeting with The Times last month, Mr. Trump pointed out the absence of laws governing conflicts of interest for a sitting president. “The law’s totally on my side, the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” Mr. Trump said, defending his decision to remain attached to his business, even with a loosened grip. He said then that he preferred to turn it over to his children, with his elder daughter taking the lead. Some on the transition team have privately expressed concern over how foreign and domestic interests could seek to curry influence with the president by doing business with his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, that ultimately accrues to Mr. Trump’s financial benefit. At least part of Mr. Trump’s reluctance to sell off his holdings stems from tax liability concerns, according to a person briefed on the plan. Government officials can defer capital gains taxes on assets they sell to avoid conflicts, providing they reinvest the money in government securities or certain approved mutual funds. But the bill comes due if those assets are sold after a person leaves office. Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, who grew up in their father’s business and are currently executive vice presidents, have told people that complaints about appearances of impropriety could be a continuing distraction for their father as he puts together his administration. Jan W. Baran, a leading Republican ethics lawyer, said that even though the law was clearly on Mr. Trump’s side, there were no easy answers on what he should do about his financial holdings. If he keeps a stake in his company, persistent questions about whether he is acting in the country’s interest or his business interest will be “unavoidable,” Mr. Baran said. On the other hand, Mr. Baran said, if Mr. Trump decides to divest, that raises other questions. “Who are you going sell it to?” he said. “Does selling his stake eliminate the ethical issues, or does it compound them?” There will also be lingering questions related to Mr. Trump’s children, depending on the structure the family settles on for running the company, Mr. Baran added. As outlined, the plan could leave in place many of the potential conflicts of interest growing out of a real estate and licensing business that spans at least 20 nations, in places like India, Indonesia and Turkey. Richard W. Painter, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, and who is planning to police the Trump administration in a role with the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, noted that the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution prohibits government officials from accepting gifts and payments from foreign governments or corporations controlled by foreign governments. Investments or loans from foreign   financial institutions, even diplomats staying at or hosting events at Trump hotel properties, could run afoul of that clause, Mr. Painter said. Mr. Trump will also have to take care to ensure that concessions that benefit his company are not construed as a bribe intended to influence official action. Mr. Painter said that even setting aside the legal questions, everything Mr. Trump does will be filtered through the lens of how he stands to benefit financially. “There are ways to make it work legally, but the appearances are going to be terrible and it’s going to be a   ethical challenge,” Mr. Painter said. Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and both Mr. Bush and his father held their assets in blind trusts while in office. President Obama did not use one, but he had minimal investments and they were unlikely to pose direct conflicts. His wife, Michelle Obama, gave up her professional responsibilities before he took office. While it is unclear what structure Mr. Trump proposes to set up to wall himself off from   the continuing involvement of two of his children in the business would complicate matters. And for a trust to be truly blind, experts say that the assets would have to be liquidated  —   and that Mr. Trump, who will be the wealthiest president in American history, would have to have no knowledge of how the proceeds were invested.\n",

The Post documented that Raju in less than three years took 52    trips for all or part of 78 workdays. City taxpayers forked out $15, 196 for 20 of those trips. Ponte’s fall was prompted by his own extensive travels, in his case with improper use of   vehicles. But it’s also true that violence rose at Rikers on his watch. Yet the mayor defended Ponte for two weeks after his indefensible abuses hit the news, just as he had earlier denied the failures of Taylor and Carríon. And of course he stands by Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña, despite the poor results of the Renewal Schools program. Nor does de Blasio ever admit that the failures of so many of his top managers reflect on him. Far from it: As Ponte announced his “retirement” Friday, the mayor was in Connecticut, picking up his son at Yale. Ironically, the mayor always (quite legally) heads up there in a   vehicle.\n",

            "Message: It Was Dishonest to Blame Trump for Anti-Semitism Those who were terrorized by the bomb threats against Jewish community centers around North America breathed a sigh of relief when the alleged perpetrator was arrested on Thursday. The fact that the person behind the more than 100 threats turned out to be an Israeli Jew was the sort of thing that left many Jews feeling a bit ashamed that a   could have carried out this vile deed even if, as has been reported, he may have a brain disorder and be mentally disturbed. But the reaction from some of the liberal groups that had used these incidents to blame President Donald Trump for what they claimed was a surge of   had to involve more than a few blushes. The arrest of the person who had been tracked down by the joint efforts of the FBI and Israeli police provided an astonishing end to a crime story that had generated widespread outrage. This is not the first time a hate crime against an ethnic or religious minority turned out to have been committed by a member of the targeted group. Nor should it blind the world to the reality of   since, as FBI   statistics have consistently shown, such offenses far outnumber those committed against members of any other faith, including Muslims, the group that has supposedly been under siege from a mythical    backlash.   groups do spout hate against Jews and, in an even more prevalent and dangerous trend, the far Left and Islamist groups have joined forces in promoting   hate that masquerades as  . The narrative of Trump’s unleashing the beast of   incitement had a certain superficial logic to it, since his behavior while running for president was, at best, insensitive, and, at worst, he seemed at times to be dog whistling to extremists. But it was a bit too convenient to be true. The arrest of the Israeli teenager, along with the arrest of a   writer in another   case, makes the effort to connect the dots between the bomb threats and Trump a fiasco. Had the mastermind behind the more than 100 threats been a white supremacist or someone who could have been labeled an   sympathizer or even an extremist Republican, it would have vindicated the effort to blame the president. Instead, Democratic politicians and liberal groups who pushed this narrative ought to apologize, if not to the president, then to their deceived constituents who eagerly applauded an    version of events that linked a political opponent to hate. That won’t happen, because the same liberals who were so heavily invested in blaming Trump are already falling back to the position that even if the president didn’t inspire those who committed these crimes, his conduct was still reprehensible and might have incited somebody to do something bad somewhere. But after months of hyping a few egregious incidents into a   panic about   it will take more than such a lame rationalization to wipe the egg off of their faces. Liberal Jewish groups and their supporters were devastated by Trump’s victory and were naturally drawn to efforts to “resist” his presidency. And the bomb threats provided them with a coherent narrative they could use to justify stepping over the line into open partisan warfare against the new administration. The tipoff that there was something wrong with this narrative was the way   who were themselves responsible for promoting   attacks on Israel and its supporters jumped at the opportunity to blame Trump for Jew hatred. Among them was Linda Sarsour, a   who was one of the chief organizers of the women’s march against Trump on inauguration weekend and then of the “women’s strike” in March. She is also a supporter of the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanctions) movement that trades in   invective and delegitimization. She was nonetheless embraced as a heroine by many Jewish liberals. The desire to build a bigger   coalition was so great that not even her comment to Vanity Fair that Jewish women would not be accepted in the protest movement unless they disavowed Zionism wasn’t enough to deter some on the left from associating with her.   exists in the fever swamps of the far Right, but the chief proponents of   invective in the public square today are those on the left who disguise their   behind a thin veneer of  . It is this strange alliance of Islamist and liberal elites that is the driving force of the trend that the Obama State Department correctly labeled a “rising tide of  . ” But in their eagerness to associate Trump with Jew hatred, liberals hitched their wagon to a false narrative in which a political opponent could be tarred with the brush of hate. By “crying wolf” about Trump, liberal groups not only undermined their own credibility, they also diverted attention from genuine problems like the BDS movement and made it harder to focus on combating their hate. For all of his obvious flaws, Trump is clearly well disposed to both Jews and Israel. Yet Jewish liberals were too invested in their opposition to him to understand that by linking him to   they were making a colossal strategic error. Making   a political football, instead of a cause that unites both parties and their leaders, was a dangerous game that has now blown up in their faces. Correcting that mistake should start with an apology, but it must also involve a realization among liberals that the “everybody I don’t like is Hitler” paradigm not only does nothing to combat   but will also make it more difficult to mobilize public opinion the next time a genuine threat arises.,\n",

            "Message: Hershey rejects $23 billion Mondelez takeover offer The snub underscores the challenges Mondelez Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld faces in wooing Hershey’s controlling shareholder, the Hershey Trust, a $12 billion charity created by the eponymous company’s founder a century ago.  The maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups saw its shares trade above Mondelez’s bid of $107 per share in cash and stock, indicating investors expected a new offer. A merger of two of the world’s top five candy makers would add Hershey’s strong U. S. business to Mondelez’s global footprint.      Earlier, a source said that Mondelez had sought to provide assurances to Hershey that it would keep its name and preserve jobs. Mondelez sees little antitrust risk given the limited geographic overlap of the two companies’ businesses, the source added. ”The board of directors of the company unanimously rejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondelez and the company,” Hershey said in a statement.     Hershey shares ended trading on Thursday up 16. 8 percent at $113. 49, while Mondelez rose 5. 9 percent to $45. 51.     Mondelez, the maker of Oreos cookies, is the   confectionary company globally, while Hershey ranks number five. Their merger would put them in the top place at 18 percent of the market, according to market research firm Euromonitor International Ltd. The combined company would leapfrog Mars Inc, which has 13. 3 percent of the global market. A fusion of the two would give Mondelez control over the production and distribution of Cadbury brand chocolates in the United States, which Hershey currently holds the license to produce, paying royalties to Mondelez.  It would also give Mondelez the U. S. production and distribution rights for Kit Kat, one of the most popular chocolate brands in the world, which industry sources said would be a significant boost to Mondelez. Nestle SA ( ) manufactures Kit Kat worldwide, but Hershey has the rights in the United States, paying Nestle royalties from sales. Mondelez’s bid could put pressure on Nestle to consider its own bid for Hershey.  Upon change of control at Hershey, the license would revert back to Nestle for free, depriving value for a potential acquirer. HERSHEY TRUST TROUBLE The bid pits Deerfield,   Mondelez against the Hershey Trust, one of Pennsylvania’s wealthiest charities. The trust has about 81 percent of Hershey’s voting rights and in 2002 prevented the Hershey,   company from being acquired by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co for $12 billion. Pennsylvania’s attorney general also sued to block the Wrigley deal, arguing it would hurt the local community. Created by Hershey founder Milton Hershey to provide for the Milton Hershey School, a private school for children from   families, the trust has been the subject of an investigation recently by Pennsylvania’s attorney general over conflicts of interest and mismanagement.  The trust’s chief compliance officer was put on leave last month after a leaked memo showed the board had spent nearly $4 million investigating conflicts of interest and   accusations against board members. A top trust official was also sacked in May and pled guilty to wire fraud. STARTING POINT Tigress Financial Partners LLC analyst Philip Van Deusen said he expected the offer price to increase, given the rise in Hershey’s shares. ”I think ($107) is a good starting place,” he said. Analysts have been skeptical of takeover bids for Hershey in the past.    ”The Trust . .. is outwardly very committed to keeping the company independent,” Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said in June last year. ”So it’s pretty much impossible for an activist to get involved or for the company to be bought.”  Last year, William Ackman revealed his activist hedge fund Pershing Square had built a stake worth about $5. 5 billion in Mondelez, in what was seen as an attempt to push the company to boost earnings or sell itself. Ackman joined fellow activist Nelson Peltz as an investor in Mondelez.

            "Message: I’m a Democrat but Clinton staffer Jennifer Palmieri’s twisted logic is exactly why we lost Got it. White men bad, women good. In Palmieri’s political world, she believes that we can cruise to electoral dominance if we build a coalition of voters based on identity politics. In other words, if Democrats can get a particular slice of Americans to the polls  —   women, Jews, ethnic minorities, gay men and lesbians   —   we will win. The idea for this dates back most famously to 2004 when political experts John Judis and Ruy Teixeira published their book, “The Emerging Democratic Majority. ” They convinced my party that hard data  —   demographic, geographic, economic, and political data  —   forecasted the dawn of a new progressive era.  They argued that there was a massive wave of Democratic voters in the country’s urban areas just waiting to support the party, and would do so for generations to come. In short, we couldn’t lose. We just needed to better organize these various categories of people and inspire them to show up on Election Day. Unfortunately for my fellow Democrats  —   and the country  —   these political experts made a series of bad assumptions that has proven disastrous.  First, they assumed that each category of people was largely homogenous. For instance, people like Palmieri would make the case that all gay men are basically the same.   Next, the experts came up with policy solutions and related messaging to cater to a category’s specific needs. Again, gay men would likely respond to increased funding for   research, so that’s what was pushed in   media outlets. With those two pieces in the bag, the actual candidate running for office was important but not terribly so, provided that she or he stuck to the script. And so that was our approach taken in 2016 Clinton was anointed as our nominee. Voters didn’t need to like her.   polls seemed to support this strategy. The liberal Huffington Post put her chances of winning at 98 percent. My friends in the Democratic National Committee started jockeying for positions at the White House last summer. And then, on November 9, America woke up to   Donald Trump. As a   campaign and party struggled for answers  —   coming up with a litany of excuses  —   they missed the obvious: successful campaigns are built on candidates first, policies second, and coalitions of voters last. We had it completely backwards.   I will offer up myself as an example. By all measures in Palmieri’s playbook, I should have pulled the lever for Hillary Clinton. I’m a Democrat and voted for President Obama twice. I’ve got a college education and, for years, I lived in big cities. I support renewable energy instead of foreign oil. I’m also gay and have faced discrimination throughout my life. Slam dunk for Team Clinton? Not so fast. I was  —   and remain  —   appalled at her vote in Iraq that sent 4, 491 servicemen and women to their deaths.  Equally egregious, she bragged about killing Libya’s dictator despite him no longer being a threat to our country. The result of that fiasco? Dead soldiers and Ambassador in Benghazi, a new safe haven for the Islamic State, and a refugee crisis that threatens Europe’s stability to this day.  In sum, she pushed for wars without reason she lacked the judgment to be commander in chief. To the horror of my party, it turns out that I think critically. I do not follow the party line. Moreover, the Clinton campaign profoundly misunderstood my identity. I am an American first, a family man second, and a Democrat third. My sexual orientation is deeply important but it does not dictate how I vote. After wrestling with what to do on Election Day, I decided on Gary Johnson I couldn’t stomach Clinton and didn’t trust Trump. In fact, I still don’t. But the American people chose differently. Whether I like it or not, Donald Trump will be the president of the United States in just over a month.  It is now my solemn duty to follow the example I learned at the Central Intelligence Agency: salute my flag and commander in chief irrespective of my party affiliation, all while staying true to those Democratic values that I hold dear. I will not whine or protest. I will not demand a recount. Instead, I will encourage people to support President Trump as their conscience allows, and oppose him respectfully and fairly where they cannot. We owe him the chance to succeed. That’s how adults behave in a democracy. To Palmieri and Democrats who think like her, I urge our party to reconsider our embrace of identity politics. Most Americans simply do not care that Secretary Clinton won more votes than any other white man. It’s an offensive and intellectually lazy argument to make.  We will not be falsely divided into a nation of neat categories. If you cannot accept that, then please go away. And take your fellow ideologues with you. If, however, you can accept this new direction, we can once again make our case to the American people  —   white, black, and brown gay and straight Christian and Muslim rural and urban  —   that we are a party worthy of their vote.  The country deserves a faithful opposition, and that requires a credible voice to hold Trump accountable. Unless we ditch identity politics and stop whining, we will not be taken seriously. Instead, we will be stuck at the edge of an electoral abyss.  Bryan Dean Wright is a former CIA ops officer and member of the Democratic Party.

Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF Two explosions ripped through a protest in Kabul on Saturday, killing at least 61 people and wounding 207 others in one of the deadliest bombings to strike the Afghan capital since 2001. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack through Amaq, the organization’s de facto media arm, which said two bombers detonated suicide belts in the crowd. Al Jazeera has more details: Mohammad Ismail Kawoosi, a spokesman for the Afghan health ministry, warned that the death toll could rise further. Graphic television footage from the site of the blasts showed many dead bodies lying on a bloodied road in Deh Mazang circle, close to where thousands of the Hazara had been demonstrating over the route of a planned multimillion dollar power line. ”I was in the crowd of protesters when a loud bang occurred nearby. Many people have been killed or injured   I am in deep shock,” demonstration organiser Jawad Naji told the AFP news agency. The blasts targeted a demonstration by the country’s Hazara ethnic minority, which makes up between 10 and 20 percent of Afghanistan’s population. According to the Guardian, protesters had gathered to demand the Afghan government divert a planned   line to Turkmenistan through two provinces with large Hazara communities.   militias in Afghanistan control far less territory than their counterparts in Iraq and Syria. But its growth and resilience in some of the country’s rural provinces in recent years has drawn international concern. In January, President Obama authorized U. S. forces stationed in Afghanistan to launch offensives against ISIS militias. The Taliban has also vied with local ISIS militias for control of key towns and smuggling routes.\n",

            "Message: Forget Trump and Clinton. ‘Black Jeopardy’ is SNL’s best political sketch this year. Just before midnight Saturday, Tom Hanks put on a denim shirt, a goatee and a red “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” hat, and in six minutes pulled off the best political sketch of the year  —   and it didn’t even feature Kate McKinnon or Alec Baldwin as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. “Saturday Night Live” has staged its “Black Jeopardy” sketch a few times before, pitting its African American cast members against white guest hosts who can’t overcome their own whiteness to answer clues about black culture and jargon. This time, though, the white contestant  —   a Trump supporter named Doug played by Hanks  —   proved to be surprisingly adept at “Black Jeopardy. ”    After Leslie Jones picked a category titled “They Out Here Saying,” Kenan Thompson read the clue: “They out here saying that every vote counts. ” Hanks buzzed in and answered in a   drawl: “What is ‘Come on, they already decided who wins even ’fore it happens.’ ” “Yes!” Thompson cried, as the studio audience cheered and the black contestants nodded in approval. “Man, the Illuminati figured that out months ago!” Historically, the sketch has embellished black stereotypes and mocked white people’s political correctness. This time around, it found common ground between African Americans and rural white conservatives: a sense of disenfranchisement, a distrust of authorities and, more playfully, an appreciation of curvy women. Under the category “Big Girls,” Thompson read this clue: “Skinny women can do this for you. ” “What is ‘Not a damn thing,’ ” Hanks answered, again to wild cheers from the audience and a   from Leslie Jones. “My wife, she’s a sturdy gal. ” “That is my man right there,” Jones said.  The sketch  —   written by “Weekend Update”   Michael Che and SNL   writer Bryan Tucker  —   was smart, funny and topical (a rare trifecta on SNL) and slyly illustrated that America’s problems are just as much about class as about race. In a campaign year that’s hinged on racial discord, partisan rancor and a deep suspicion of anyone who is “other,” the sketch was deliciously cathartic. Tweeted MTV politics writer Ezekiel Kweku: “best analysis of the white working class and the presidential election I’ve seen this cycle. ” Tweeted former Jeb Bush staffer Tim Miller:   This Black Jeopardy skit is as good as folks are saying.

The “Final Jeopardy” category was “Lives That Matter. ” Jones and fellow contestant Sasheer Zamata looked balefully at Hanks, who froze as the audience laughed. “Well, it was good while it lasted, Doug,” Thompson said.

            "Message: Paul Nehlen Billboard Hits Ryan on Trade JANESVILLE, WI —   Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen has launched his latest billboard ad against House Speaker Paul Ryan. [The new billboard focuses on Ryan’s support for trade policies that have shipped jobs overseas and have laid off Wisconsin workers.  The billboard reads: “Ryan’s trade policies have laid off millions of workers. Send Ryan his   notice on August 9th. ” The billboard is on display in Ryan’s hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin. Behind the billboard’s text is a picture of the Janesville General Motors assembly plant, which announced its official closure last year after years of remaining idle. The image of the abandoned GM plant may have special emotional significance for the residents of Janesville. As Janesville’s GazetteXtra reported in March: “GM operated a plant in the city from 1919 to 2008, employing as many 7, 000 people at its peak. From 2008 to 2015, it sat empty and unused on ‘standby’ status. The company announced last fall that it will officially close. ” Days before the 2012 Presidential election, Business Insider ran a story featuring photos of the deserted plant in a piece entitled, “Heartbreaking Photos Of The Shuttered GM Plant In Paul Ryan’s Wisconsin Hometown. ” Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney went on to not only lose the state of Wisconsin in the 2012 election, but they lost Paul Ryan’s hometown of Janesville by 25 points. Since Paul Ryan took office in 1999, Wisconsin has lost   of its total manufacturing jobs. Just last November, Oscar Meyer announced that it was shutting down its headquarters in Madison, “wiping out hundreds of jobs at a company that has been a part of the community’s fabric since 1919,” according to the Associated Press: The company [Kraft Heinz Food Co.] plans to shed a total of 2, 600 jobs. About 300 corporate workers in Madison will be offered jobs at the company’s   in Chicago the remaining 700 or so production workers here will lose their positions in three waves of layoffs over the next two years. Janesville resident Joshua Nehls, age 38, who had worked at the Madison plant for a decade, described the closure as “tragic. There were a lot of tears (when company officials announced the closure). A lot of people’s lives are here. ” Madison mayor Paul Soglin described the economic impact as “very significant  …     These men and women have dedicated their lives to this company, and they and their families are of the utmost concern to me,’ Soglin said. ‘They are the heart and soul of the Northside. ’” As McClatchy has reported, trade has become a critical issue in the 2016 election. McClatchy writes, “Trade deals costly in key election states: In Wisconsin and across the industrial Midwest, economic angst is coupled with a sense of betrayal”. April Wisconsin exit polls showed that a majority of Wisconsin GOP voters (54%) believe that foreign trade kills jobs. Pew polling data shows that by a nearly    margin, GOP voters believe that   “free trade” deals lower American wages rather than raise them. Only 11% of GOP voters believe these trade deals will increase wages. However, despite the views of Republican voters, Paul Ryan has been one of Congress’s most vocal advocates for globalist trade policies. In 2015, Ryan acted as President Obama’s “partner” in his effort to fast track the   Partnership. In a 2015   Ryan praised the TPP as a “historic” trade agreement that would “mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers, and ranchers. ” Wisconsin suffered a net loss of nearly 40, 000 jobs in 2015 alone due to the U. S. trade deficit with TPP countries, according to the Economic Policy Institute. New reports indicate that the TPP “is expected to be put before Congress during the   session” after the voters have cast their ballots in the November 2016. Interestingly, Wisconsin exit polls also revealed that a majority of Wisconsin Republicans (51%) say they feel betrayed by the party, which is currently led by Speaker Ryan.\n",

            "Message: EFG agrees to buy BSI from Brazil’s BTG Pactual for $1.3 billion  EFG International AG ( ) has agreed to pay 1. 33 billion Swiss francs ($1. 34 billion) for Grupo BTG Pactual SA’s Swiss   unit BSI Ltd in a deal that could catapult it into the nation’s   money managers for the wealthy. The acquisition, which comes five months after   BTG Pactual ( ) sealed a deal to buy BSI for 1. 25 billion francs, will be paid for in cash and stock. Under terms of the deal, EFG will incorporate BSI, making BTG Pactual the No. 2 partner in the combined firm after Greece’s Latsis family. Prior to the BSI deal, EFG had been the   player in a market where consolidation has gained traction as smaller banks struggled with tougher oversight and an erosion of Switzerland’s secrecy laws. For BTG Pactual, the sale brings in   cash after the November arrest of founder André Esteves triggered massive client money outflows. Reuters reported last Friday, citing sources, that BSI could be valued at 1. 6 billion francs, giving BTG Pactual up to 30 percent of the combined entity. BTG Pactual and EFG had been in exclusive negotiations over BSI for about a month. Once the transaction is concluded, EFG will become Switzerland’s   private bank behind UBS AG UBSG. VX, Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN. VX, Julius Baer Gruppe AG BAER. VX and Banque Pictet & Cie SA, with operations spanning Europe, the Americas and Asia. ”It gives us the next plateau,” EFG Chief Executive Joachim Straehle told reporters in Zurich. In a statement, BTG Pactual said the final price for the deal could range between 1. 5 billion and 1. 6 billion francs, when taking into account BSI’s profits until the deal is closed. The São   bank will have a stake of 20 to 30 percent in the new company, only to trail the Latsis’ estimated 35 percent, when the deal closes. EFG plans to fund the deal by raising 500 million francs in equity and 250 million in additional Tier 1 capital instruments. The prospect of a new share issue weighed on EFG, whose shares fell 9. 1 percent to 6. 09 francs. In a statement, EFG said it would pay 975 million francs in cash, giving BTG Pactual a roughly 20 percent stake. The stake could rise to 30 percent if the share offering gets bogged down. ”Since EFG was almost condemned to buy for not having critical mass, and because possible acquisitions don’t grow on trees, the deal makes sense,” Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts wrote in a client note. MALAYSIA FUND Still, one of the main sticking points in negotiations was how to handle potential penalties from BSI’s ongoing legal issues, which include a money laundering scandal related to the 1Malaysia Development Bhd, a sovereign fund from the Asian country. The deal includes setting up a ”substantial” escrow account which EFG believes will protect it from any penalties, it said, without giving details. BSI, which BTG Pactual bought from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA ( ) has declined to comment on the scandal but pledged to cooperate fully with authorities whenever necessary. The price that EFG paid for BSI is around 1. 5 percent of the 88 billion francs in BSI’s assets under management, with the typical price for such deals around 1. 5 to 2 percent.  Fluctuations in the new money that BSI attracts or changes in tangible book value by the time the deal is closed, which is expected by the end of 2016, could affect the price, EFG said. The BSI sale will also help BTG Pactual move on with a plan to sell assets, raise cash and restore investor confidence in the wake of Esteves’ arrest. Esteves was the architect of BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI last year, which he said would help the independent investment bank grow beyond Latin America. BTG PACTUAL Without BSI, BTG Pactual’s income from wealth management may substantially decline. BSI represented about 69 percent of BTG Pactual’s 1. 455 billion reais ($369 million) in proceeds from the unit last year. BTG Pactual remains undecided on how to book proceeds from EFG’s activities when the deal is cleared, said Pedro Lima, the bank’s global head of investors relations. He also noted that EFG and BTG Pactual have yet to discuss a corporate governance framework for the merger, including the appointment of board members. According to Bloomberg News, BTG Pactual plans to use proceeds form the BSI sale to repay an emergency credit lifeline it obtained in December, right after Esteves’ detention. The bank could even seek to buy out minority shareholders, the report said, citing two unnamed sources.

            "Message: Trump Invites Republican Congressional Leaders to White House for Healthcare, Tax Reform, Overseas Trip Discussions WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   On Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump will host a handful of Republican congressional leaders at the White House for a dinner centered around the President’s first trip abroad. [He will also preside over an afternoon bicameral Republican leadership meeting to discuss plans for healthcare and tax reform.  Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short briefed reporters late Monday on the meetings, as well as updates on the President’s legislative agenda. Short said that a “handful” of Republican House and Senate leaders would come to the White House for a dinner on Tuesday. They will discuss the President’s recent overseas trip, his first foreign trip since assuming the office of President of the United States, and will also discuss foreign policy challenges that the United States faces. For the dinner, President Trump will host Sens. Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Todd Young, Cory Gardner, and Reps. Francis Rooney, and Lee Zeldin. Tuesday afternoon, Trump will host a bicameral Republican leadership meeting in which the group will discuss a path forward on legislation. Healthcare and tax reform will be included, according to Short. He said: On healthcare we are looking forward to delivering the choice and control that Americans want in their own individual health plans. We are looking forward to delivering the affordability that Americans need and the quality that they deserve. The American people are anxious about healthcare. Obamacare is an unaffordable disaster that is collapsing around the country today. Attendees of the afternoon bicameral meeting will be Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Rep. Steve Scalise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Sen. John Cornyn. Short cited increases in health insurance premiums under Obamacare from 2013 to 2017 of 123% increase in Louisiana, 176% in North Carolina, and 203% in Alaska. On average health insurance premiums have more than doubled in the U. S.  —   increases of approximately $3, 000 per plan. Moving to the tax reform discussion the leaders will have on Tuesday, Short said, “In order to jumpstart the economy we need to cut taxes for both businesses and individuals. ” He cited a low average two percent rate of growth in the economy over the past eight years. Short added of plans for tax reform, “The plan will provide tax cuts by simplifying the tax code, broadening the base, and increasing growth. ” He indicated that a tax reform bill will likely come after Labor Day. While the Trump Administration continues to endeavor to make bipartisan strides on tax reform, Tuesday’s meeting will be a conversation for Republican leaders. In response to questions from reporters on whether tax reform will be revenue neutral, Short said that the goal is for tax reform to be revenue neutral, but the greater priority is to provide growth. On tax reform, the Trump Administration hopes to avoid having separate bills on tax reform from the House, Senate. and White House. Instead, through discussions on the issue, the administration hopes to see one bill that all three can pass into law. Short later told Breitbart News that the White House recognizes the urgency expressed among Americans to see tax reform and healthcare reform passed. The Trump Administration expects to see a summer focused on passing the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and the FY2018 budget. In the fall, the administration is looking to continue to make the case for FY2018 spending bills, ensure funding for border security, and pass a tax reform package. During the briefing, Short also highlighted the 36 bills that Trump has already signed into law and the executive orders that Trump has signed thus far. Short said this is a pulling back of the Obama era regulatory burden. “These bills and executive orders save our economy $18 billion dollars annually in regulatory compliance costs,” he said.

            "Message: Three-Month-Old Baby Eaten Alive by Giant Rats  A    baby girl in South Africa has been eaten alive by giant rats after her mother left her home alone to go out drinking. [The baby lay on a bed as rodents devoured her before her mother came home to find the baby’s remains, the Daily Mail reported.  Her mother, 26, has been arrested on charges of child neglect. The girl’s twin brother, Lucky, was spared from death because the mother took him with her on her night out. “The baby could only have died a painful death. The infant’s tongue, eyes and fingers had all been eaten,” a neighbor said. “This woman must rot in jail. She does not deserve to be a mother. ” “The only thing this woman likes is going out partying in the local shebeens,” said Noluthando Mtshali, daughter of the mother’s landlady. “I just could not bring myself to go in and see what happened to this poor child. ” “When people were asking where the other child was, she would say it was in her sister’s care,” she added. The surviving twin is now in the custody of his    father and his new girlfriend. This isn’t the first time a baby has been eaten alive by rats. Rats ate a    baby to death in Mexico after the mother left the baby to go out dancing in January. In 2011, there were two separate cases of rats eating babies in South Africa that happened on the same day.  One victim was a    girl from Khayelitsha while the other was a baby girl from Soweto township.\n",

            "Message: Philippines’ Duterte: We’ll turn to Russia if US won’t sell us guns  (CNN) Outspoken Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte had a blunt message for the United States after reports emerged of a potentially blocked arms sale. ”They’re blackmailing me that they won’t sell weapons? We have lots of explosives here,” Duterte said, according to CNN Philippines. And suggested, the country would turn to Russia for its weapons. ”[I] remember what the Russian diplomat said: Come to Russia, we all have here anything you need.” The comments were in response to a report from Reuters that the US State Department halted the sale of about 26, 000 assault rifles to Philippines police over concerns about the country’s recent human rights record. State Department Spokesman John Kirby said he could not comment on the arms sale due to federal regulations. Philippine National Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa said his country will look elsewhere if it can’t buy rifles from the United States. At a news conference Wednesday, dela Rosa said he had not received official notice the sale had been blocked. ”We really need those firearms for our public safety forces in the PNP,” said dela Rosa, according to CNN Philippines.  The amount of guns is not a huge loss from the Philippines    they can buy guns from other people, says Richard Javad Heydarian, a political science professor at De La Salle University, Manila. However, it’s clearly a sign the Obama administration is losing patience with the Philippines, Heydarian told CNN. ”It’s a shot across the bow    it’s a warning shot,” he said. ”Washington will not turn a blind eye to alleged human rights abuses.” The war on drugs, Duterte was elected after pledging to wage an   war on drugs. Since he’s taken office, the country has seen a sharp rise in violence and extrajudicial killings. Duterte’s war on drugs has drawn the ire of the international community, but he remains an incredibly popular President with high approval ratings. Another bedrock of Duterte’s time in office    a shift in the country’s international alliances. Duterte has brought his country closer to China and Russia while vowing to distance the United States. Philippines’ Duterte to US: ’Do not make us your dogs’ China and the Philippines recently struck an agreement on fishing rights to a disputed shoal in the hotly contested South China Sea.    Duterte dumps the US: What could be lost? Duterte has hinted in the past that he’s keen to strengthen   ties.  He’s also said that Russia could serve as an alternative arms supplier.\n",

            "Message: Clinton Campaign Accuses Obama-Appointed IG of Conspiring with GOP on E-mail Report Hillary Clinton’s campaign went on the attack Wednesday morning against a new inspector general’s report that affirms the presence of “several dozen” highly classified   on the former secretary of state’s private server, accusing the government watchdog of spearheading a “very coordinated leak” with Senate Republicans to damage her reputation. On Tuesday, Fox News reported that last week,   inspector general I. Charles McCullough sent an unclassified response to an inquiry from two Republican senators. McCullough’s letter is said to contain two sworn declarations from an “intelligence community element,” asserting that dozens of   found on Clinton’s server were classified  —   including several judged to contain intelligence on   “special access programs,” which exist at a more rarefied level of classification than even the two “top secret”   discovered on the server last summer. “Two months ago there was a Politico report that directly challenged the finding of this inspector general,” Fallon said. “And I don’t think he liked that very much.

            "Message: Giraffes, Towering and Otherworldly, Are ‘Vulnerable’ to Extinction  The majestic giraffe, the world’s tallest land mammal and a prime attraction at zoos worldwide, is threatened with extinction because of illegal hunting and a loss of its habitat, according to a report published on Thursday by an international monitoring group. The giraffe population has declined by 40 percent over the past three decades and now stands at about 97, 600, according to the findings by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which designates endangered species. While the largest giraffe populations reside in national parks and reserves, those protected areas have proved to be inadequate, one of several alarming conclusions about the animals’ future in the group’s latest Red List of Threatened Species report. “While global attention has been on threats to elephants and rhinos, giraffes have been off the radar, and we’ve been losing them in significant numbers,” said Liz Bennett, the vice president for species conservation for the Wildlife Conservation Society, which was not involved in the report. “People and governments need to start acting to save giraffes, fast. ” With their soaring heights of up to 20 feet and their stunning necks, which are typically about six feet long, giraffes have long been the stuff of dreams  —   for children who love to draw them and for adults who retain an awe for the otherworldly creatures. Their tongues can extend a foot or more, making feeding times an especially popular sight at zoos and on safari. Yet the animals’ rare size and regal visage have made them a prime target of poachers in Africa, who drop   snares from tree canopies or stalk and shoot giraffes with rifles, wildlife experts say. The threat to giraffes is so great that the Red List upgraded the species from the “least concern” category to “vulnerable,” skipping over the intermediary “ ” designation. Graver categories include “critically endangered,” “extinct in the wild” and, ultimately, “extinct. ” The animals are divided into nine subspecies according to the Red List report, five have decreasing populations, three are on the increase, and one is stable. One bright spot: The numbers of West African giraffes are on the rise, numbering about 400 now, up from 50 in the 1990s. This remains the smallest of the subspecies. Asked if it was possible for giraffes to become extinct in the wild in the next 20 years if nothing is done, Derek Lee, an ecologist who contributed to the Red List report, paused for several moments during a phone interview on Thursday from Tanzania. He then said, “I think we’d see drastic declines at the very least. ” Giraffes are found mostly in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa. Some of those populations are particularly vulnerable because of war and other civil unrest in countries on the Continent, like Sudan. Poaching and the loss of habitat are “equally dangerous threats that vary in degree from place to place,” said Dr. Lee, who is a founder of the Wild Nature Institute. While governments and organizations could take stronger actions against poaching by enforcing laws and animal protection rules, habitat loss can be harder to stop because it involves curbing economic activity, such as land development, mining and scavenging. “These are problems everywhere for giraffes,” Dr. Lee said. “You need to stop both threats. ” The threat to giraffes is not expected to affect their numbers at zoos in New York and other cities around the world, wildlife specialists said, because zookeepers have a good record helping the animals with reproduction. Still, zoo leaders are likely to consider changing signs at their exhibits to stress the animals’ vulnerability to extinction as a way to raise public awareness. “That would be the best way to get the word out to people that we need to do more to protect these animals,” said Dr. Bennett, of the conservation society, which runs the Bronx Zoo, the New York Aquarium and other zoos in the city.\n",

            "Message: Federal Courts Invalidate Virginia and North Carolina Legislative Maps  WASHINGTON —  Election politics and race are back at the Supreme Court this spring, as first one, and now two, states fight to get the justices to reverse   decisions that threw out the legislative district lines adopted by state lawmakers, decisions holding that those maps included gerrymandered districts that violate the law. [Congress passed the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in 1965. Plaintiffs in both of these lawsuits —  one case from Virginia, another from North Carolina —  argue that the legislative maps adopted by both those two states violate part of the VRA and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs argue that these districts attempt to pack black voters as densely as possible into several districts that lawmakers would consider Democratic districts to increase the odds that Republicans will continue to hold the surrounding legislative seats.  VRA lawsuits are each heard by a   trial court, comprised of two federal district judges, led by one federal circuit judge from the court of appeals. The losing party may then appeal directly to the U. S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has held that there is a “presumption of good faith that must be accorded legislative enactments,” and consequently, courts must “exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis of race. ” Nonetheless, two of the three judges in Virginia ruled that parts of the Old Dominion’s map are illegal. When lawmakers did not enact a new map, the   court drew one for them, and ordered Virginia to follow it. Lawyers representing Virginia congressmen and elected officials petitioned the Supreme Court to stay the lower court’s ruling until full arguments could be heard, but the justices declined to do so without comment. The Court took the case, Wittman v. Personhuballah, which will be heard on March 21, 2016. The defendants and congressmen argue that the lines were drawn based on political considerations that are entirely proper (such as taking into account communities of common interest) and not primarily upon race. But it is not clear when a decision will come down, and Virginia’s primary elections are in May. A decision on the case might not be issued until the end of June. The   map poses challenges for some lawmakers in the meantime (or permanently, if the Supreme Court leaves it in place). Tea Party favorite David Brat —  who ousted former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor —  faces a tough reelection contest under the new map. Meanwhile, on February 5, another   court invalidated part of North Carolina’s districting map by a   vote. The defendants promise to appeal, but nothing has yet been filed at the Supreme Court. In the meantime, North Carolina will be left with the same uncertainty as Virginia. Ken Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.\n",

            "Message: Democratic Senator Blocks Obama’s Pick To Head FDA WASHINGTON (AP)  —   A Democratic senator said Monday he is blocking President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration as he pressures the agency to be tougher on abuse of opioid painkillers. Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey said in a statement that he has put a hold on the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf, the No. 2 official at the agency, who was a prominent cardiologist and medical researcher at Duke University for more than 30 years. ”The FDA needs to commit to shift the way it approaches and evaluates addiction before I can support Dr. Califf’s nomination,” Markey said. ”Until it does, we will continue to see this tsunami of opioid overdoses engulf family after family.” Deaths linked to misuse and abuse of prescription painkillers climbed to 19, 000 last year, the highest figure on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By its estimation, deaths tied to these drugs have surged more than fourfold since 1999 amid increased prescribing by U. S. doctors. Even though a Senate committee approved Califf’s nomination by voice vote earlier this month, Obama’s choice has faced opposition from several senators. Sen. Lisa Murkowski,   has also placed a hold on the nomination. At the vote, she said she wanted reassurances that FDA will write rules for labeling genetically modified salmon. She has said the engineered salmon approved by the FDA last year could be harmful to her state’s wild salmon industry. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders said the country needs an FDA commissioner who will stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and that Califf is ”not that person.” The Vermont independent said he was considering a hold. Some Democrats have raised concerns about Califf’s ties to industry. In 2006, Califf founded the Duke University Clinical Research Institute, a contract research group that has conducted studies for virtually all of the world’s largest drugmakers. Government disclosure forms show that Califf received more than $29, 000 in consulting fees, travel, meals and other payments from drugmakers in 2014. Califf has already recused himself from dealing with certain companies to avoid conflicts of interest. Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Republican chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is supporting the nomination. As head of the FDA, Califf would inherit a raft of projects and potential challenges, including unfinished tobacco regulations and food safety and labeling reforms. Former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg left the job early last year. The FDA’s chief scientist, Dr. Stephen Ostroff, is serving as acting head of the agency. ___, Follow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter at \n",

            "Message: Puerto Rico Freezes Condom Prices To Prevent Zika Profiteering To help prevent the spread of the Zika virus in Puerto Rico, government officials on the island have declared condom   illegal. In early February, during a media briefing at the governor’s mansion, Puerto Rico’s Secretary of the Department of Consumer Affairs Nery Adames Soto announced that his agency has added prophylactics to the   list. Stores on the island also aren’t allowed by DACO to raise the price on mosquito repellent, window screens, larvicides and other   products. U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed that as of Feb. 19 there were nine cases of Zika reported in Puerto Rico, a U. S. territory. Eight of them were locally acquired and one was associated with travel. Public health officials have reported more than 60 Zika cases in Puerto Rico, including three pregnant women. DACO’s Adames ordered the price freeze on condoms because of growing concerns that someone can pass the Zika virus to another person through sexual contact. He’s worried the virus can quickly spread to other municipalities. He added, people should visit the DACO website or Facebook page and file a report if they come across a business that has violated his executive order. ”Every local store, gas station or business that sells these items must know that DACO will be knocking on your doors and closely monitoring this, allowing the citizens to protect themselves adequately because now is not the time to raise prices.” Store owners may be fined up to $10, 000 for each   violation. To get a better sense of what the condom price freeze meant to the locals, NPR’s Greg Allen and I went to Condom World, a popular adult retail chain in Puerto Rico. The branch we visited is in the heart of Carolina, a beach town east of San Juan. On a typical Friday evening, tourists stroll up and down the sidewalk bustling with restaurants, pubs and other novelty shops. The curious tend to wander in to browse the provocative merchandise at Condom World. Sales clerk Coralis   says she had heard about the government declaring the condom price freeze. ”It’s stupid,” she says. ”Just because Zika is here, doesn’t mean we’re going to raise the price. That’s something we just don’t do no matter what.” A box of three condoms ranges in price from $3. 99 to $5. 99,   agrees with price freezing in general, but doesn’t think the government needs to draw much attention to condom sales as a potential threat to the spread of Zika. There are more pressing concerns like putting screens on windows and eliminating stagnant water sources. Condom World customer Beatrice Garza said a condom price freeze should definitely be in order and hopes retailers don’t take advantage of the situation. ”The mosquitoes started this. It didn’t come from sex. It came from the mosquito,” Garza says. Meanwhile, the archbishop of San Juan, Roberto Nieves Gonzales, came out with his take on the condom rhetoric. Soon after the government’s decree on the condom price freeze, Monsignor Gonzales recommended a lifestyle ”of chastity and abstinence,” instead of using a condom, to prevent the spread of the Zika virus. The first reported cases of infection were centered on the northeastern part of the island and near San Juan. But there are now confirmed cases appearing in the southern coast and parts of the interior, a sign the virus may continue to spread to other regions in the coming months. In early February, Puerto Rico’s governor declared a public health emergency on the island. The rapid spread of Zika coupled with public health messages about sexual transmission may have an economic impact on specialty stores like Condom World  ” despite a condom price freeze. Puerto Rico is already starting to see a decline in sales and tourism in other areas. Miguel Vega is the chairman of the island’s tourism association. He says these new government impositions and mandates will affect travel to the island and its hotel industry. And he’s not happy about it. ”Sometimes they take these things out of proportion,” he says, ”and it creates collective hysteria where there is not any necessity.”\n",

At the United Nations, he scarcely mentioned Syria in a   farewell address to the General Assembly. Mr. Obama’s public distancing, White House officials insist, does not reflect a lack of concern. On the contrary, they say the president is desperate for Mr. Kerry to negotiate a viable agreement with Russia that would halt the relentless bombing of civilians in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria  —   if only because he does not see a viable Plan B to stop the carnage. But as Mr. Obama’s presidency enters its final months, the negotiations with Russia have become a threadbare exercise, leaving a president who has long avoided military entanglement with Syria backing a policy that he himself believes is destined to fail. This week, his frustration boiled over publicly. The situation in Syria “haunts me constantly,” the president said in an interview with the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, published Thursday in Vanity Fair. In a mix of candor and defensiveness, Mr. Obama said he had   himself more on Syria than any other issue during his presidency. He repeated his rejection of critics who said he should have armed the moderate rebels much earlier in the conflict or carried through on his threat to take military action against the government of President Bashar   after he fired poison gas at civilians in 2013. But he conceded that there might have been a failure of imagination in his response to the conflict. “I do ask myself, ‘Was there something that we hadn’t thought of? ’” the president told Ms. Goodwin. “‘Was there some move that is beyond what was being presented to me that maybe a Churchill could have seen, or an Eisenhower might have figured out? ’” While Mr. Obama has supported Mr. Kerry’s diplomacy  —   even over the objections of the Pentagon  —   he does not want to be drawn into it. When Mr. Kerry met with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, at a Group of 20 meeting in Hangzhou, China, on Sept. 4, the two fell just short of a   agreement over what officials said were minor details. American officials suspected the Russians were stalling so the deal could be sealed in a meeting the following day between Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin. After 90 minutes, a   Mr. Obama emerged to say, “Given the gaps of trust that exist, that’s a tough negotiation, and we haven’t yet closed the gaps in a way where we think it would actually work. ” He instructed Mr. Kerry to keep talking to Mr. Lavrov, and the two came to terms five days later in Geneva. Mr. Obama, his aides said, was determined not to give Mr. Putin a platform to declare Russia was working hand in hand with the United States in Syria, particularly since he did not believe the Russians would abide by the terms of the agreement. “The president wasn’t prepared to offer the Russians what they wanted most  —   a symbolic show of U. S. cooperation  —   until the Russians delivered on their end of the bargain,” said the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest. “That’s why the bargain is structured the way it is. And it’s rooted in our skepticism that they would deliver. ” “The president doesn’t want U. S. credibility to be sullied by Russia’s dishonesty and willingness to sacrifice principle in the name of convenience,” Mr. Earnest added. Mr. Obama’s skepticism appeared warranted when the aid convoy was hit by a warplane that American officials believe was Russian. White House officials reacted harshly. Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said, “The question is whether or not we just walk away from the table completely at this point, or whether or not we do some more diplomacy and consultation to determine whether or not there is some path forward. ” Again, though, Mr. Obama left it to Mr. Kerry to reproach Mr. Lavrov at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. To the extent he mentioned Syria during the General Assembly, it was in   humanitarian terms. At a meeting with other world leaders on the refugee crisis, Mr. Obama read a letter by a    boy from Scarsdale, N. Y. who wrote to him to offer a home to Omran Daqneesh, the    Syrian boy from Aleppo who was photographed, dazed and bloodied, after being rescued from an airstrike. The White House recorded the boy reading the letter aloud, and the video went viral on social media. Mr. Obama’s struggles with Syria are most palpable when he tries to sum up his   legacy. In his speech to the General Assembly, for example, the president cited his diplomatic overtures to Cuba and Myanmar, as well as the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, which he said exemplified the power of global collaboration. But when he referred to Syria, Mr. Obama spoke of constraints rather than possibilities. “If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,” he said, referring to Syria’s sectarian rifts. “I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts. ” Mr. Obama made no direct reference to the negotiations with the Russians, saying only, “In a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those in need. ” Several former administration officials said they understood why Mr. Obama was keeping his distance from the issue. “Frankly, I doubt Obama engaging on the diplomatic side would help much,” said Robert S. Ford, a former American ambassador to Damascus who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. “Like Kerry, Obama wouldn’t have much leverage with the   Putin unless Obama was also putting into play in the Syria war new elements of material  —   not verbal  —   pressure against the    alliance. ” Dennis B. Ross, a former coordinator of Middle East policy at the National Security Council, said Mr. Obama’s dilemma went back to the earliest days of his response to the Syria conflict, when he viewed it as a sectarian quagmire similar to that in neighboring Iraq. As the war ground on and the opposition became more Islamist, Mr. Obama’s options narrowed. Now, Mr. Ross said, the president has little incentive to say anything. “He knows that anything he says either requires him to do something if it is tough  —   and he won’t  —   or makes him look weak and ineffective on an issue that will plague his legacy,” he said.\n",

            "Message: U.S. National Guard may join cyber offense against Islamic State: Carter  U. S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the National Guard’s cyber squadrons will play an increasingly important role in assessing the vulnerabilities of U. S. industrial infrastructure and could be asked to join the fight against Islamic State. The National Guard   a reserve military force that resides in the states but can be mobilized for national needs   is a key part of the military’s larger effort to set up over 120 cyber squadrons to respond to cyber attacks and prevent them. One such unit, the 262nd squadron, is a   team that includes employees of Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google. The unit is ”famous throughout the country” for several high profile vulnerability assessments, Carter said at the Joint Base   in Tacoma, Washington late on Friday. He told reporters the squadron was not currently engaging in offensive cyber missions but could be in the future. ”Units like this can also participate in offensive cyber operations of the kind that I have stressed we are conducting, and actually accelerating, in Iraq and Syria, to secure the prompt defeat of ISIL, which we need to do and will do,” Carter said. ”We’re looking for ways to accelerate that, and cyber’s one of them.” The 262nd squadron’s work includes a study last year on the control system used by Snohomish County Public Utility District in Washington state, which helped the utility strengthen its security, and a 2010 case in which the U. S. Air Force briefly lost contact with 50 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles.  The 2010 assessment cost about $20, 000, much less than the $150, 000 that a private sector company would likely charge, said Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Borchers, deputy commander of the 252nd Cyber Operations Group, which oversees the 262nd squadron. Borchers said the squadron is the only National Guard group that currently assesses industrial control systems, but it is now looking to train others. It is also studying the security of big weapons programs, such as the   bomber. Using National Guard units for such work made sense because it allowed the military to benefit from private sector cyber experts, Carter said. ”It brings in the   sector in a very direct way to the mission of protecting the country,” he told reporters. ”And we’re absolutely going to do more of it.”  (Reporting by Andrea Shalal, editing by Tiffany Wu) DETROIT Baidu Inc, the top Chinese internet search firm, has formed a broad alliance to promote   cars, pitting its Apollo platform against Alphabet Inc’s system, it said on Wednesday, in hopes of getting the vehicles on the road in China by 2019. KIEV The Ukrainian software firm used as part of last week’s global cyber attack warned on Wednesday that all computers sharing a network with its infected accounting software had been compromised by hackers. \n",

            "Message: Thanks to Obama, the terrorist cancer is growing  We still do not know who or what is responsible for the crash of EgyptAir Flight 804, but we know this much for certain: The terrorist danger is growing, and it won’t be contained to the Mediterranean. Responding to criticism of President Obama’s handling of terrorism, White House press secretary Josh Earnest boasted Thursday of all the setbacks the Islamic State has experienced in recent months, noting that in Iraq “45 percent of the populated area that ISIL previously controlled has been retaken from them. In Syria, that figure is now 20 percent. ” That’s like a patient who ignored a cancer diagnosis bragging that he finally reduced the tumor in his lung  —   glossing over the fact that he let it spread and metastasize to his other organs. If he had attacked the Islamic State cancer early, Obama could have stopped it from spreading in the first place. But instead, he dismissed the terrorist group as the “JV team” that was “engaged in various local power struggles and disputes” and did not have “the capacity and reach of a bin Laden” and did not pose “a direct threat to us. ” He did nothing, while the cancer grew in Syria and then spread in Iraq.  Now the cancer has spread and metastasized across the world.  According to a recent CNN analysis, since declaring its caliphate in 2014, the Islamic State has carried out 90 attacks in 21 countries outside of Iraq and Syria that have killed 1, 390 people and injured more than 2, 000 others. The Islamic State has a presence in more than a dozen countries and has declared “provinces” in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Post reported in 2015 that “since the withdrawal of most U. S. and international troops in December, the Islamic State has steadily made inroads in Afghanistan” where it has “poured pepper into the wounds of their enemies . . . seared their hands in vats of boiling oil . . . blindfolded, tortured and blown apart [villagers] with explosives buried underneath them. ”    On the day an EgyptAir plane carrying 66 people disappeared over the Mediterranean Sea, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that investigators will look into all ”potential factors that may have contributed to this tragedy.” (White House)   And while the Islamic State spreads and grows,   is making a comeback. Obama is touting the killing of Taliban leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansour as “an important milestone,” but the truth is that the Taliban has made major military gains in Afghanistan  —   and that has opened the door to  . The Post reported in October that “American airstrikes targeted what was ‘probably the largest’   training camp found in the   Afghan war. ” Sounds good except for one small problem: There were no major   camps in Afghanistan when Obama took office. Now it is once again training terrorists in the land where it trained operatives for the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.    has also regained lost ground in Yemen, the country where it trained and deployed the underwear bomber who nearly blew up a plane bound for Detroit in 2009. And as a recent report from the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats Project notes, the “Syrian al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra poses one of the most significant   threats of any   group” and “is much more dangerous to the U. S. than the ISIS model in the long run. ” Overall, Gen. Jack Keane recently testified that   has “grown fourfold in the last five years. ” We’re lying to ourselves if we think that the violence we are witnessing is going to be confined to the Middle East . . . or South Asia . . . or North Africa . . . or Europe. It is only a matter of time before the Islamic State and   bring this violence here to our shores.  Indeed, in many ways we face a situation far more dangerous and complex than we did before Sept. 11, 2001. Before   we largely faced a danger from one terrorist network ( ) with safe haven in one nation (Afghanistan). Today, we face danger from multiple terrorist networks with safe havens in a dozen or more countries. Moreover, we face something we have never seen before: two terrorist networks  —   the Islamic State and    —   competing with each other for the hearts of the jihadi faithful and the backing of jihadi financiers. The way to win that competition is to be the first to carry out a catastrophic attack here in the United States.   When it came to terrorist networks, the George W. Bush administration had a mantra: We’re going to fight them over there so that we do not have to face them here at home. Obama abandoned that mantra. And now the danger is getting closer to home with each passing day.   Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.                 \n",

            "Message: First U.S. Zika virus transmission reported, attributed to sex  The first known case of Zika virus transmission in the United States was reported in Texas on Tuesday by local health officials, who said it likely was contracted through sex and not a mosquito bite, a day after the World Health Organization declared an international public health emergency. The virus, linked to severe birth defects in thousands of babies in Brazil, is spreading rapidly in the Americas, and WHO officials on Tuesday expressed concern that it could hit Africa and Asia as well. Zika had been thought to be spread by the bite of mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, so sexual contact as a mode of transmission would be a potentially alarming development. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed it was the first U. S. Zika case in someone who had not traveled abroad in the current outbreak, said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden on Twitter. However, the CDC has not investigated how the virus was transmitted. After this case, the CDC advised men to consider using condoms after traveling to areas with the Zika virus. Pregnant women should avoid contact with semen from men exposed to the virus. The Dallas County Department of health said on Twitter that the person was infected through sexual contact with someone who had traveled to Venezuela. The person infected did not travel to the South American country, county health officials said. The Texas Department of State Health Services was slightly more cautious in its assessment, saying in a statement, ”Case details are being evaluated, but the possibility of sexual transmission from an infected person to a   person is likely in this case.” County authorities said there were no reports of the virus being transmitted by mosquitoes in the Texas county. Previously, international health officials had noted one U. S. case of possible    sexual transmission. But the Pan American Health Organization said more evidence was needed to confirm sexual contact as a means of Zika transmission. The medical literature also has one case in which the virus was detected in semen. The virus has been reported in more than 30 countries and linked to microcephaly, in which babies have abnormally small heads and improperly developed brains.     The American Red Cross on Tuesday asked blood donors who have traveled to Zika virus outbreak areas such as Mexico, the Caribbean, or Central or South America to wait at least 28 days before donating. However, the risk of transmitting the virus through blood donations remained ”extremely” low in the continental United States, the disaster relief agency said. The Dow Jones transportation average ended 2. 9 percent lower following news of the first U. S. transmission of the Zika virus. MONITORING NEEDED The WHO has said the virus could infect 4 million people in the Americas. It said on Tuesday it launched a global response unit to fight the   virus. ”Most important, we need to set up surveillance sites in   and   countries so that we can detect any change in the reporting patterns of microcephaly at an early stage,” Dr. Anthony Costello said in Geneva. Costello is WHO’s director for maternal, child and adolescent health. Twenty to 30 sites could be established worldwide, mainly in poor countries without robust healthcare systems, Costello said. Brazil is the country hardest hit by Zika. In an address to a joint session of Brazil’s Congress, President Dilma Rousseff said her government will spare no resources in mobilizing to combat the mosquito that transmits the virus. With no vaccine or treatment for Zika, efforts to curb its spread have focused on eradicating mosquito breeding sites. Brazil, which has more than 4, 000 suspected cases of microcephaly that may be linked to Zika, is scheduled to host the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August. Rousseff also said Brazil and the United States will enter a partnership to develop a Zika vaccine as soon as possible to stem the spread of the virus. VACCINE EFFORTS French drugmaker Sanofi SA on Tuesday announced that it has launched a project to develop a vaccine against the virus, the most decisive commitment yet by a major vaccine maker. The company said its Sanofi Pasteur vaccines division would use its expertise in developing vaccines for similar viruses such as yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and dengue. Other companies also joined the race on Tuesday to develop a vaccine. The University of South Australia said it was working on a Zika vaccine with Australian biotech Sementis Ltd. U. S. drug developer NewLink Genetics Corp said it has started a project to develop Zika treatment options. Experts have said a Zika vaccine for widespread use is months if not years away. Costello said the Aedes mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus ”are present . .. through Africa, parts of southern Europe and many parts of Asia, particularly South Asia.” Africa and Asia have the world’s highest birth rates. WHO   Margaret Chan said on Monday it was ”strongly suspected but not yet scientifically proven” that Zika causes microcephaly. The first Irish cases of Zika virus have been detected in two people with a history of traveling to a country affected by the   infection, the Health Service Executive of Ireland said. Chilean health officials said they have confirmed three cases in Chile of people infected with the Zika virus, all of whom were infected while traveling elsewhere in Latin America. An Australian state health service said two Australians were diagnosed with the virus after returning from the Caribbean, confirming the first cases of the virus in the country this year.

            "Message: ’Kept me out of jail’: Top DOJ official involved in Clinton probe represented her campaign chairman Peter Kadzik, who was confirmed as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in June 2014, represented Podesta in 1998 when independent counsel Kenneth Starr was investigating Podesta for his possible role in helping   Clinton intern and mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. “Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,” Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta’s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. CLINTON AIDE’S EMAIL TESTIMONY COULD HAUNT HER, Kadzik’s name has surfaced multiple times in regard to the FBI’s investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for using a private, homebrewed server. After FBI Director James Comey informed Congress on Thursday the FBI was reviving its inquiry when new evidence linked to a separate investigation was discovered, congressional leaders wrote to the Department of Justice seeking more information. Kadzik replied. “We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,” Kadzik wrote on Oct. 31. See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → The DOJ is responsible for approving the bureau’s warrant applications and ultimately for convening a grand jury. Fox News has previously confirmed the Justice Department was opposed to Comey making public the latest Clinton revelations. Kadzik had been an attorney with Dickstein Shapiro LLP for 18 years before he represented Podesta in the   investigation. He was hired in 2000 as a lobbyist for tax cheat Marc Rich, who was controversially granted a pardon by President Bill Clinton during Clinton’s final days in office. Kadzik got the job “because he was ‘trusted by [White House Chief of Staff John] Podesta,’ and was considered to be a ‘useful person to convey [Marc Rich’s] arguments to Mr. Podesta,’” according to a 2002 House Oversight Committee report. Podesta and Kadzik kept up their relationship after Kadzik was appointed to the DOJ. In a May 5, 2015 email, Kadzik’s son, PJ, wrote to Podesta seeking a job on Hillary Clinton’s newly launched presidential campaign. “I have always aspired to work on a presidential campaign, and have been waiting for some time now for Hilary [sic] to announce so that I can finally make this aspiration a reality,” PJ Kadzik wrote. Podesta said he would ”check around,” but it’s unclear what came of the request. Kadzik was also a dinner guest of Podesta and his wife, Mary, on Oct. 23, 2015  —   the day after Hillary Clinton testified before the House Benghazi committee, another email shows.  In a separate exchange about another dinner meeting, on Jan. 12, 2016, Kadzik emailed Podesta: “We on?” Podesta replied, “Yes sorry. 7:30 at our place. ” “Great. C u then,” Kadzik wrote back the next day. Though he said he has had ”many differences” with Kadzik, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R. . C. said on ”Fox  Friends” Tuesday that he wasn’t concerned about any potential conflicts of interest. ”Peter Kadzik is not a decision maker, he is a messenger,” Gowdy said.  Kadzik is still a key official in the department. He “led the successful effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates,” according to his DOJ biography. Lynch has come under increased scrutiny since it emerged she met privately with Bill Clinton in the days before the FBI initially said it would not seek to prosecute Hillary Clinton.   \n",

            "Message: The High Stakes of Jeff Sessions’s Confirmation To understand why the Democrats have chosen to attack Senator Jeff Sessions’s nomination for attorney general in a particularly ruthless and unhinged fashion, one needs only remember the Willie Sutton Rule  —   Sutton famously robbed banks because “that’s where the money is. ” The Democrats are attacking Jeff Sessions because the Department of Justice is where the power is. For many years now, but particularly under President Obama, The Democrats the have wielded this power against ordinary Americans. They’ve defined justice in ways that have no relationship to American laws as written. They’ve stacked the DOJ’s bureaucracy with leftist activists. And they’ve used the DOJ as a cudgel with which to beat their political enemies while handing out privileges and preferences to groups they favor. Jeff Sessions is going to put a stop to this without apology or equivocation, and that’s why he is the most fundamental threat to leftist power of any of Trump’s cabinet nominees. The Trump team recognizes the high stakes  —   a defeat of Sessions would be the repudiation of the one senator who was an early supporter of the campaign  —   one who gave credibility to the campaign with conservatives because of his acknowledged mastery of policies and issues too often forgotten by the GOP establishment. It’s no coincidence that the Democrats are trotting out Cory Booker  —   until last week, the only   Democratic senator, and a man who was full of public praise for Sessions earlier this year  —   to engage in the unprecedented act of testifying against another senator’s confirmation to a cabinet post. Booker referenced the “the immense powers of the attorney general combined with the deeply troubling views of this nominee” as his reason for opposing Sessions. Senator Sessions will ensure that the DOJ acts in the interest of justice rather than “justice” as defined by President Obama’s DOJ. Cruz noted: “The Obama Department of Justice openly ignored the laws it didn’t like. . . . The DOJ has sunk to extraordinary depths. And Senator Sessions has been there every step of the way, exposing the seedy underbelly of the administration. ” It’s not an accident that California, ground zero of the resistance to the   has hired President Obama’s former attorney general, Eric Holder, for advice about how it can most effectively fight the federal government under President Trump. While it is pleasing to see the Democrats rediscover the wisdom of federalism, that wisdom does not allow California to defy federal law. Sessions is the canary in the coal mine for conservatives in the Trump administration: If his confirmation is not looking healthy, the entire conservative prospect under a President Trump could soon take ill. Of course, he is not perfect, and like anyone with decades of experience in public life, he has made mistakes, but on the vast majority of policy issues that should concern conservatives, he’s been a leader. He’s served for more than 20 years in the U. S. Senate without controversy or rancor, and for the Democrats to engage in    —   as if they only now have discovered that their formerly valued and respected colleague is some sort of Klansman from Meryl Streep’s nightmares  —   is absurd. As Margaret Thatcher once said, “This is no time to go wobbly. ” Jeff Sessions has the right friends  —   and the right enemies. He should be confirmed swiftly and with the unanimous support of his GOP colleagues. At the same time conservatives need to apply pressure to the ten Democratic Senators up for 2018 reelection in states that voted for Trump. These   moderates were silent through the lawless years of the Obama DOJ  —   if they suddenly discover their love of “justice” through opposition to Senator Sessions, voters need to be reminded where they stand come election time. Senator Booker, in explaining his upcoming testimony against Sessions, said, “This is one of the more consequential appointments in American history right now. ” And on that, both Senator Booker and conservatives can find grounds for agreement.,\n",

            "Message: Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’ suddenly seems to be popular again      Few would have imagined that Adolf Hitler’s autobiography “Mein Kampf” would again become a bestseller in the 21st century. But that’s exactly what happened earlier this year with the expiration of a German state copyright that had been used to prohibit reprinting of the book. On Saturday, “Mein Kampf” became even more widely accessible in Europe. The Italian newspaper Il Giornale distributed copies of the book to readers of its Saturday edition  —   a decision that drew heavy criticism from Jewish groups in the country. The Italian news agency ANSA quoted the president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, Renzo Gattegna, as saying: “The free distribution . .. is a squalid fact that is light years away from all logic of studying the Shoah and the different factors that led the whole of humanity to sink into an abyss of unending hatred, death and violence. ” “It must be stated clearly: The Giornale’s operation is indecent,” Gattegna said Friday, on the announcement of the paper’s decision. But the   daily, which is owned by the family of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, says its version of the text was annotated by an Italian historian and was distributed with the goal of preventing the mistakes of the past from being repeated. As for the controversy, Alessandro Sallusti, the paper’s director, in an editorial said that most of the discussions related to the publication were “legitimate and understandable. ” “The worries of our friends within the Italian Jewish community, who have always seen us as unconditional allies, deserve all our respect,” Sallusti wrote. However, he also said that he strongly disagreed with those saying the paper published the autobiography with an“apologetic intention. ” Critics had previously argued that the newspaper might have distributed the book in an attempt to underplay Hitler’s crimes. Sallusti strongly refuted such allegations, saying:“Let’s not take advantage of such a tragedy. ” “Because with certain winds that blow here and there in Europe and in the Middle East it is necessary to understand what shapes the evil can take    in order not to repeat a fatal mistake,” Sallusti wrote, referring to Hitler’s rise to power. “Mein Kampf” has been available in German bookstores since January  —   but only in an annotated version that is supposed to point out inconsistencies and lies in Hitler’s arguments. There are more than 3, 000 additional comments in that version. According to German law, publishing the book without annotations would be considered seditious. But that is what   publishing company Schelm is now planning to do. Prosecutors are investigating the plans and could file charges even before the book gets published. “This book is too dangerous for the general public,” library historian Florian Sepp told The Washington Post last year, reflecting a sentiment among several German experts on that research field. The publisher argues that an unannotated version of Hitler’s autobiography would serve as historical documentation  —   but researchers object, saying that the annotated edition is fully sufficient. If published, the unannotated book would primarily have to be sold online, as most German bookstore chains would likely refuse to put it on their shelves. The majority of German bookstores had ordered only a handful of copies of the annotated version in January, despite massive interest among readers, which later made it a bestseller within weeks.

            "Message: Crash rates for self-driving cars less than conventional car: study    cars are involved in fewer crashes on average than vehicles with a driver behind the wheel, a study released on Friday by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute shows. The study was commissioned by Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, which has reported a series of minor crashes involving its   fleet. It looked only at Google’s fleet of more than 50   cars, which has logged 1. 3 million miles in Texas and California in   mode. The test fleet has reported 17 crashes over the last six years, although none were the fault of the   cars, Google said. After adjusting for severity and accounting for crashes not reported to police, the study estimated cars with drivers behind the wheel are involved in 4. 2 crashes per million miles, versus 3. 2 crashes per million miles for   cars in autonomous mode. Crash rates for conventional vehicles at all severity levels were higher than   crash rates, the study found. A 2015 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study found about 60 percent of    crashes and 24 percent of all injury crashes are not reported to the police.  California law requires all crashes involving   vehicles be reported to police. Google spokesman Johnny Luu said the company asked Virginia Tech ”to look into the topic given the interest and develop a robust methodology to be able to make meaningful comparison between regular cars on the road as well as our   cars.” Luu said the study ”will be helpful making    comparisons moving forward.” A study released in October by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute compared crash rates among Google, Delphi and Audi   cars in 2013 and found they had a higher rate than for conventional cars. But that study noted the low volume of driverless miles    1. 2 million compared with 3 trillion miles driven annually on U. S. roads.  In December, California proposed state regulations that would require all autonomous cars to have a steering wheel, throttle and brake pedals when operating on California’s public roads. A licensed driver would need to be in the driver’s seat ready to take over in the event something went wrong. Google, eager to demonstrate its vehicles are safe, criticized the proposed rule, which it said would maintain ”the same old status quo and falls short on allowing this technology to reach its full potential, while excluding those who need to get around but cannot drive.”  (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Dan Grebler) DETROIT Baidu Inc, the top Chinese internet search firm, has formed a broad alliance to promote   cars, pitting its Apollo platform against Alphabet Inc’s system, it said on Wednesday, in hopes of getting the vehicles on the road in China by 2019.

            "Message: Gun Violence Researchers Fear Trump Will Erase Their Data  Researchers in UC Davis’s Violence Prevention Research Program are worried President Trump will simply erase their data the way his administration erased climate change data from the White House web site. [The fear took hold on inauguration day, when members of the Violence Prevention Research Program watched the Climate Change information disappear.  Wired reports that Magdalena Cerdá saw the Climate Change information vanish and viewed is as a “call to action. ” She said she “worried the same thing could happen to gun violence data on websites belonging to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ” Cerdá was on an Amtrak train when she noticed the Climate Change material disappearing and she “sent an email to Garen Wintemute saying [they] needed to start downloading   …     data immediately. ” The goal was to get all the online resource material saved to a   drive so they would have it, even if an outside party ordered it removed or inaccessible on the internet. Veronica Pear is a data analyst at the Violence Prevention Research Center. She said, “I was scared. ” Pear is using “federal data for a paper on firearm mortality —  tracking hotspots in California between 1999 and 2015 —  and her work is almost complete. ” She said she had grown accustomed to finding the information she needed via online searches, and had therefore never downloaded or backed anything up. But once Cerda announced the erasure of Climate Change information, Pearl began searching and storing information. She said, “I had to enter around 50 different queries, I felt frantic. ” UC Davis now has untold numbers of resources saved on secure servers. Pear described the compilation of the material as “a public service for the scientific community. ” She added, “And for me, it feels more important now than ever to be vocally on the side of truth. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

The funnyman appeared flummoxed Tuesday night by his “Late Show” crowd’s jubilant reaction to the news that  . “Huge story that broke just minutes ago, less than 10 minutes ago. FBI Director James Comey has just been fired by Donald Trump,” Colbert said on the show. “Huge, huge Donald Trump fans here tonight,” said   who explained that the president owed Comey a debt of gratitude for helping him win the White House. The crowd apparently viewed the top lawman’s demise as great news, after he angered Democrats by announcing in late October that emails related to Hillary Clinton had been found,  Clinton also has blamed Comey, in part, for her loss in the election. Colbert went on to tell his audience that Comey was leading an FBI probe into possible ties between the Russians and Trump’s campaign. And when he said that Comey was axed at the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the people booed  —   much to Colbert’s obvious satisfaction. “I think I might know why. I think he was fired because Comey couldn’t guess the name, ‘Rumpelstiltskin,’” Colbert quipped.

            "Message: Yahoo launches auction process as Starboard gears up for fight Yahoo YHOO. O shares jumped after the company announced its board has formed a committee of independent directors to explore strategic alternatives, and that it has hired investment banks and a law firm to run the process.  The launch of the auction process, a move activist hedge fund Starboard Value and other shareholders have pushed since late last year, showed the company was moving another step closer to selling its core business, which includes search, mail and news sites, rather than spin it off as previously planned. The move follows more than three years of effort by CEO Marissa Mayer to turn around Yahoo by focusing on mobile apps and trying to boost advertising revenue.  Yahoo had acknowledged during its earnings last month that it was open to exploring options for its core business. Despite the launch, Starboard’s founder Jeffrey Smith is not backing down, and will continue his pursuit of nominating a group of directors for the Yahoo board, people familiar with the matter said.  Smith stated in a letter to the board on Jan. 6 that if the board is unwilling to accept the need for significant change, ”then an election contest may very well be needed so that shareholders can replace a majority of the Board with directors who will represent their best interests.” Even though the board is showing that it’s now willing to accept that need, Smith is still going to nominate a slate of directors to ensure that the sales process is handled properly, people familiar with the matter said. The window for a shareholder to nominate a director or group of directors to the Yahoo board begins on Feb. 25 and ends on March 26, with the annual meeting expected to be held in May, according to the company’s proxy statement.  ”It seems pretty clear that the only reason this is happening even is because of the threat of the proxy fight,” Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. Starboard, which owns about 0. 75 percent of Yahoo, declined to comment. Yahoo’s attempt to sell its core business comes after shelving previous plans to spin off its stake in ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( ). ”Separating our Alibaba stake from Yahoo’s operating business is essential to maximizing value for our shareholders,” Mayer said on Friday. Yahoo’s board is concerned about the risk of losing a possible proxy contest, investor Eric Jackson, of SpringOwl Asset Management, said.  Yahoo’s committee of independent directors has engaged Goldman Sachs & Co Inc ( ) J. P. Morgan ( ) and PJT Partners Inc as financial advisers, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP as legal adviser. Verizon Communications Inc ( ) is among the companies seen as a potential buyer of Yahoo’s core business.

Woods, 41, blamed the incident on medications. Woods had ”extremely slow and slurred speech” after being awakened by a Jupiter police officer, who found the car the golfer was driving stopped in the right lane of the roadway and still running with the right blinker light flashing, the report said. Woods was heading south, away from his Jupiter Island home, before his arrest at about 3 a. m. (0700 GMT) on Monday, according to the report. It said Woods was cooperative but had a hard time walking and keeping his eyes open. The police report said that during his interaction with the arresting officer, Woods ”changed his story of where he was going and where he was coming from.” At one point he indicated he was returning from a golf trip in Los Angeles, the report said. The athlete, currently sidelined from competition after his fourth back surgery in April, said on Monday that an unexpected reaction to legal drugs led to his arrest on the DUI charge. He also was cited for improper parking. Two breath tests showed Woods’ blood alcohol content to be zero, according to the report, which added he performed several field sobriety tests incorrectly. ”I want the public to know that alcohol was not involved,” Woods said in a statement. ”What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. I didn’t realize the mix of medications had affected me so strongly.” Woods apologized, saying, ”I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again.” Woods, who is second on the   list with 14 major titles, was released from jail on his own recognizance and is due in court on July 5, records show. This was not Woods’ first   with Florida police. A bizarre early morning car crash outside his   in 2009 rapidly ballooned into a sex scandal involving allegations of extramarital affairs with several women. His previously unblemished life and career were turned upside down as he lost both his marriage and some lucrative endorsement deals.

            "Message: Texas New Black Panther Party Leader: Blacks ‘Are Being Pimped Like Prostitutes’ by Democrats HOUSTON, Texas  —   The leader of Houston’s New Black Panther Party said blacks “are being pimped like prostitutes” by Democrats and should listen to the message from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump reached out to members of the black community last week during a speech following riots in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [Houston’s New Black Panther Party leader Quanell X addressed Trumps Milwaukee speech on a Fox 26 Faceoff with conservative radio talk show host Matt Patrick. “Let me say this to the brothers and sisters who listened and watched that speech,” he said. “We may not like the vessel that said what he said, but I ask us to truly examine what he said. ”   “It is a fact, that for 54 years we have been voting for the Democratic Party like no other race in America,” Quannel continued. “They have not given us the same loyalty and love that we have given them. We, as black people, have to   the relationship where we are being pimped like prostitutes and they’re the big pimps  —   pimping us politically, promising us everything, and we get nothing in return. ” During Trump’s Milwaukee speech, the GOP nominee laid the blame for problems in America’s inner cities squarely at the feet of Democrats and specifically to Hillary Clinton, Breitbart News’ Warner Todd Huston reported. “To every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in the inner city or every forgotten stretch of our society, I’m running to offer you a much better future, a much better job,” Trump said. The messages appears to have hit home with Quanell X and some other black activists across the country. “We’ve gotta step back now, as black people, and say that we’ve gotta look at all the parties and vote our best interest,” the Houston New Black Panther Party leader said. His sparring partner, Matt Patrick, agreed and said that the mainstream news media has been painting Trump as “a horrific individual and he can’t do anything right. ” He said they are nervous that Trump might come in and do things the right way. “Things that come out of his mouth, and the way he says things sometimes, I shake my head. ” Quannel responded saying, “He (Trump) spoke directly to black people, and I want to say, and encourage the brothers and sisters, Barrack Obama, our president, served two terms. The first black president ever. But, did our condition get better? Did financially, politically, academically with education in our community, did things get better?” He continued illustrating his point asking, “Are our young people working more than what it was when he came into office? Their condition got worse. ” “So now,” he surmised, “We’ve got to do what the honorable Eliah Muhammad said, ‘No politician can save the black community.’ We’ve gotta do it ourselves. ” “Only a fool fights in a burning house,” Quanell X said. “This house is on fire. ” Patrick responded, “Remember that if you’re planning on voting for Hillary Clinton. Other black leaders have joined in speaking out about the Democratic Party’s taking the black electorate for granted. Speaking at the Green Party’s presidential nominating convention in Houston earlier this month, a   black community leader, a former Democrat activists, spoke to blacks who were looking to find another party to support. “Are you going to try to go inside there and reform this [Democratic] Party, that has demonstrated in every way, with every opportunity, that they really do not give a flying f**k about what it is you care about?” YahNé Ndgo said. “And for me, that’s not a hard decision. ” “We saw what happened through the whole primary process,” Ndgo continued. “We saw what the Democratic Party did to the incredible candidacy that Bernie Sanders brought to the table and we saw what the Democratic Party did to the voters who selected Bernie, and who they blocked, and who they put someone else in that position who was not the person that the majority of the people selected, and who have experiencing no consequences to that reality. Right?” “And you live in a Democratic city, and you are supposed to be believing in the Democrats that run your city. How’s that supposed to happen?” she asked. Radio host Matt Patrick told Breitbart Texas in an interview on Friday he has been talking with Quanell X about the treatment of the black community by the Democrat party for over a year, encouraging him to say this publicly. “I really don’t think he is   us on this,” Patrick said. “I don’t think he would. ” Patrick said he hopes members of the black community will listen to Quanell’s message about the last eight years of Obama’s administration and the last 50 plus years of the Democratic Party’s control of major cities where race related crime runs rampant.

            "Message: ’A great victory for animals’: bestiality may finally be outlawed in Ohio Ohio has moved one step closer to outlawing bestiality after a bill banning sexual abuse of animals passed the state legislature. It is currently legal to have sex with animals in nine US states, plus Washington DC. John Kasich, Ohio’s governor, will now decide whether to sign the bill, which also prohibits the sale of animals for sex. The bill is the result of a lengthy campaign by the Humane Society of the United States, an animal welfare charity which is aiming to ban bestiality nationwide. “The passage of animal sexual abuse legislation is a great victory for the animals of Ohio,” said Leighann Lassiter, animal cruelty policy director at the Humane Society.  Lassiter and the bill’s sponsors, Ohio senators Jim Hughes and Jay Hottinger, have stated that animal abuse can often be a precursor to the abuse of children. “This legislation will give law enforcement and prosecutors the ability to identify potentially dangerous sexual predators who may also be abusing children in their community,” Lassiter said. Once Kasich receives the bill he will have 10 days to sign it into law or veto the legislation. If he chooses to do neither, the bill will pass into law by default. The bill prohibits a person from “sexual conduct” with an animal, but also targets what Lassiter described as “organized sex rings”. “There are people out there who train animals for sex,” she said. “You can give them your dog and they will train your dog to have sex with a human and send it back to you. And they get paid for it. “It is a very, very seedy world when it comes to animal sexual abuse and it is extremely common. ” States where bestiality is illegal do have animal cruelty laws, Lassiter said, but these are often inadequate when it comes to people sexually abusing animals. A person sexually abusing an animal might only be prosecuted if the animal is injured, while livestock or wild animals may be exempt from existing law. “We’ve got cases of people grabbing birds and having sex with birds. And killing the birds. It is really really disturbing,” Lassiter said. People have advertised animals for sex on Craigslist and on specific bestiality websites, actions which are also not covered under some states’ existing cruelty laws.  Lassiter said some states are lacking specific bestiality laws because animal sex abuse was covered under historic laws that also banned gay sex. In some cases when those laws were repealed bestiality was not reintroduced as an offense. Bestiality is currently legal in Vermont, Texas, West Virginia, Kentucky, Nevada, Hawaii, Wyoming, New Mexico and Ohio, and in Washington DC. The Humane Society is aiming to introduce legislation banning the practice in the first five of those states in 2017.\n",

            "Message: Shocking video shows mother cheering as her 4-year-old boy is thrown from a bridge          On hot summer days in Montesano, Wash. locals like Kaylub Fawley know that the Wynoochee River is one of the best places to cool off. Fawley has been going to the popular spot for years with friends to swim, to relax and  —   when he’s feeling adventurous  —   to make the daring   plunge from the Devonshire railroad bridge into the water below. “We’ve been jumping for so long, we know how to do it without getting hurt,” the    told The Washington Post. “But we also know the consequences. You have to be careful. ”    Kaylub Fawley and Brianna Jones. (Courtesy of Kaylub Fawley and Brianna Jones)  Fawley was shocked, then, to look up last week and see a child being tossed off the bridge into the river. The teen had his smartphone out and managed to record the child’s terrifying plunge. “I looked up and was like, ‘Whoa, there’s a kid up there’  —   I immediately started recording,” Fawley told The Post. “This guy just threw the kid right off the bridge, and he smacked down right on his neck. ” “As soon as that kid hit the water, he went straight down and straight back up,” Fawley added, noting that the child disappeared underwater before his life jacket quickly pulled him back to the surface. “He was just screaming the whole time. ” Swimmers who witnessed the shocking scene reported it to police. Then, the following day, Fawley posted the video on Facebook, writing that “this is what happens when some parents just don’t care. ” The boy’s mother can be heard cheering as her child plummets toward the water  —   which, Fawley said, ranges from about eight to 12 feet deep, depending on how much it’s rained recently on the Olympic Peninsula. The sound of the child’s body smacking the water is also audible. “When he landed, I thought he broke his neck,” another witness, Brianna Jones, told The Post. “Usually, people that jump off the bridge are my age or older. ” Jones, who is 19, said the child nearly hit his head on a steel beam on his way down; he barely missed some of the large underwater boulders that experienced jumpers are keen to avoid. But what happened next was even more shocking to the dozens of swimmers gathered in the water, Jones said: As soon as the screaming child surfaced, she said, his mother “was trying to make it seem like the whole incident was fun. ” Jones said she, Fawley and other swimmers began reprimanding the woman  —   and the woman began screaming back. “We all started freaking out and yelling at her, ‘You can’t do that!” Jones recounted. “She said, ‘He’s my kid, and it’s none of your business. ’” “You just don’t throw a kid off a bridge!” Jones added. “It made me so mad.   …     People like that shouldn’t have children. ” Jones and Fawley said police arrived within 15 minutes and were shown the video. “The police officer watched it several times, and he was pretty upset,” Fawley said, noting that the boy was treated in an ambulance and later released. “I kept asking if the little boy was all right, and the cop said he was fine, but he was shaken up pretty bad. ” Authorities said the boy is 4 years old. Steve Shumate, a spokesman for the Grays Harbor County Sheriff’s Office, told The Post that the local prosecutor’s office is still deciding whether to charge the mother with child endangerment, a class C felony. The man seen on camera throwing the child off the bridge is the mother’s boyfriend and is also under investigation, Shumate said. Investigating officers initially believed the woman should face “reckless endangerment and criminal trespassing charges, which are both misdemeanors,” the sheriff’s spokesman said. “I’m waiting for the rest of the police reports to come in,” he added. “I spoke with the county prosecutor, and they’re going to determine whether felony charges are going to be filed. ” Fawley told The Post he decided to make the video public because he wants people to understand the consequences of child endangerment. “I hope that mother gets what’s coming to her,” he said. “I just want that child to be safe. ” This post has been updated.

            "Message: What the last 48 hours told us about Trump’s next 4 years  (CNN)  Donald Trump went    Wednesday with a press corps itching to   him after more than five months at arm’s length, while his top nominees faced off with senators during a strategic crush of confirmation hearings. The raucous 48 hours, beginning on Capitol Hill early Tuesday, represented an unofficial inauguration of the 45th president    a whirlwind welcome to Trump’s Washington, a chaotic and contentious place where graying norms seem destined to clash relentlessly with an idiosyncratic administration.  By Thursday morning, after a Senate    effectively paved the way for GOP efforts to dismember Obamacare, new information had emerged and old suspicions were affirmed, as the final countdown to the historic transition neared its end. Here are seven lessons    and the moments that defined them    from the past two days:    1. The lesson: Trump escalates his conflicts with the media and other perceived enemies, The moment: At his news conference Wednesday, the   refused to hear a question from CNN’s Jim Acosta. Incoming press secretary Sean Spicer then threatened to throw Acosta out of the room if he persisted in asking.  ”I have great respect for the news, great respect for freedom of the press and all that,” Trump said during his   press conference Wednesday.  But the lovefest had its limits, as the   ripped CNN and BuzzFeed over a pair of stories published the day before    CNN’s a carefully sourced report BuzzFeed’s a less scrupulous document dump    and purposefully conflated the two in order to avoid answering serious questions about his and his staff and advisers’ alleged ties to Russia.  Trump passed over Acosta during the news conference and Spicer threatened to eject him if he spoke up again. When ABC’s Cecilia Vega pressed Trump on the matter, the   spent nearly 90 seconds filibustering before heading for the elevators, where he eventually denied to reporters that he or anyone on his team had been in contact with the Russians during the campaign. 2. The lesson: Republican Russia hawks could emerge as Trump’s most galvanizing opponents, The moment: Marco Rubio on Wednesday blitzed secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson over his connections to Russia and whether, in his opinion, Vladimir Putin was a ”war criminal.” Unlike Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a day earlier, Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil chief with extensive business ties to Moscow, was confronted with a blistering round of inquiries from the senators who will decide if his nomination vote goes to the full chamber. Rubio in particular pressed Tillerson with a categorical question. ”Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?” the Florida senator asked. Tillerson hedged, saying he ”would not use that term” and required ”much more information” before giving a clear answer.  Rubio pressed on, running off a laundry list of Russian aggression, from its actions in Aleppo to the murder of dissidents and journalists, but Tillerson didn’t budge.  Further questions about human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines were met with similar demurrals. By late Wednesday, Amnesty International USA had weighed in with their growing concerns. ”After a day of questioning, Tillerson’s commitment to human rights in the US and abroad is in serious question,” the group’s executive director, Margaret Huang, said in an email. ”He must use tomorrow’s hearing to clarify today’s troubling statements.” 3. The lesson: A Justice Department led by Jeff Sessions will not vigorously police the police  The moment: Asked on Tuesday for his opinion on the Justice Department’s use of consent decrees to oversee and reform police departments with records of abuse, Sessions expressed serious doubts. During the tenures of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, the Justice Department has been proactive in applying oversight measures to local law enforcement outfits found to have committed civil rights violations. The department has used a tool called a consent decree    a period of enforced reform, with terms agreed by municipal authorities and Justice Department officials as a means of avoiding federal court action. Ferguson, Missouri and Cleveland are among the wide range, in size and prominence, of cities to sign on after   offenses. ”I think there is concern that good police officers and good departments can be sued by the Department of Justice when you just have individuals within a department that have done wrong,” Sessions said when asked during the first day of his hearing. ”These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness, and we need to be careful before we do that.” With an attorney general    and Sessions is all but guaranteed to be confirmed    so openly critical of the process, it’s hard to imagine the Trump Justice Department will be initiating the reviews that became a hallmark of its predecessor. 4. The lesson: Protesters    not a beleaguered Democratic minority    are set to emerge as leaders in the   resistance, The moment: The Sessions confirmation hearings, Day 1. While senators mostly treated Sessions with deference during what many had expected to be a fraught and tense confirmation hearing, Democrats were not nearly as vocal as the demonstrators that frequently interrupted the proceedings. Protesters from a variety of grassroots progressive groups and larger liberal organizations were often the harshest voices in the room during Sessions’ hearings. They rose at seemingly regular intervals to rail against the Alabama senator, who was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 amid allegations he made racist comments to a colleague. More recently, Sessions has emerged as a vocal backer of voter ID laws.  Activist Kai Newkirk, who was arrested during a   at Sessions’ office, told CNN Wednesday he was willing to be jailed because ”Sessions’ history and present positions make it undeniably clear that he cannot be entrusted to uphold equal justice, civil rights, or the right to vote.” Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee panel were mostly restrained in their questioning, with Minnesota’s Al Franken the rare Sessions colleague to confront him over his past record    deliberately overstated, Franken suggested    as a civil rights proponent. With their party set to turn over the White House, and already nearly powerless in Congress, Democrats sitting on Capitol Hill could soon take a backseat to progressives and allied groups planning to stand up to Trump with mass protests and direct actions.  5. The lesson: Difficult conversations about race in policy clashes and political conflicts aren’t going anywhere during the Trump era.  The moment: Both Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights hero, and Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, testified against Sessions on the second day of his confirmation hearings. As their colleagues came under fire for offering what liberals saw as an overabundance of senatorial courtesy, Lewis, Booker and Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond zeroed in on Sessions’ history with a sharper edge. ”Those who are committed to equal justice in our society wonder whether Sen. Sessions’ call for ’law and order’ will mean today what it meant in Alabama when I was coming up back then,” Lewis said during his testimony. ”The rule of law was used to violate the human and civil rights of the poor, the dispossessed, people of color.” Booker, meanwhile, sought to channel the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when he said, ”The arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve toward justice, we must bend it.” ”America needs an attorney general who is resolute and determined to bend the arc,” Booker testified. ”Sen. Sessions’ record does not speak to that desire, intention or will.” Booker’s decision to so publicly oppose a Senate colleague    he is the first to do so in a confirmation hearing    shed light on the depth of the racial fault lines that figure to roil the new administration and its critics.   Difficult conversations are obviously not new in this country and they escalated during the course of the Obama administration, when Americans were focused at various times on Ferguson, Baltimore, Black Lives Matter and the very visceral fight over voting rights and the Confederate flag. Trump and his cabinet will bring a very different perspective than Obama and his. Partisan fights over race seem destined to escalate over the coming four years. 6. The lesson: The role of the FBI, in particular Director James Comey, in the 2016 campaign will remain a flashpoint in 2017, The moment: Democrats were alternately outraged and baffled when, in the course of a hearing with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey refused to comment on whether the bureau was investigating links between   Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.   The question came from Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. He wanted to know whether the FBI had investigated potential contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia.  The director, however, was not in a forthcoming mood and refused to comment. Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, couldn’t help himself. ”You didn’t say one way or another whether even there was an investigation underway?” King asked again. ”Correct,” Comey said. ”I don’t, especially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny a pending investigation.” ”The irony of your making that statement here, I cannot avoid,” King said, a clear reference to Comey’s looser lips during the campaign, when he jolted the contest with a very late public revelation that his agents would renew their review of emails potentially tied to Hillary Clinton’s private server. Clinton was cleared, again, days later, but many Democrats believe the brouhaha cost her precious votes in a race that was ultimately decided by the narrowest of margins in a handful of states. Like Trump, their grudge is likely to endure. 7. The lesson: The leader of the Democratic Party is Barack Obama    and no one else comes close  The moment: In his farewell address from Chicago on Tuesday night, the outgoing president delivered a stark warning about the challenges facing American democracy while, both in the speech and recent remarks, offering a more coherent path forward than anyone else in his party. Obama said goodbye in much the same way he entered national politics    with an appeal to a shared decency and common interests across the partisan divide. But a decade on from the beginning of his brief Senate stay, the   president addressed a country more openly at odds over race. ”After my election,” Obama told supporters in McCormick Place, ”there was talk of a   America. Such a vision, however   was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.” Framing that divide as a ”threat to our democracy,” Obama pleaded with Americans to emerge from their digital bubbles and more openly engage with political opposites. ”If you’re tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet,” he said to laughs, ”try talking with one of them in real life.”  But his appeal to economic solidarity    which sounded a lot more like Bernie Sanders than his   successor Hillary Clinton    struck hardest. ”If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority, then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves,” he said, while pointedly encouraging Democrats to engage ”the   white guy.” Whether that adds up to a winning strategy remains to be seen, but for a night at least, the departing Obama towered over the Democrats he leaves behind to take on Trump.\n",

            "Message: Fashion PR Firm Cancels Christmas Party Because Trump Won Fashion industry public relations firm LaForce has canceled its annual holiday bash in New York City due to Donald Trump’s stunning victory over Hillary Clinton in this year’s presidential election. [According to the New York Post‘s Page Six, firm chief James LaForce and his husband Stephen Henderson sent out a letter to invitees stating that the annual industry party  —   originally set for December 19 at Manhattan’s Irving Plaza, with a one   guest list  —   would no longer be happening this year.  “We envisioned an   celebration of Hillary Clinton’s presidency,” the letter to invitees read, according to a copy obtained by Women’s Wear Daily. “Alas, Election Day did not go as we’d hoped. So it’s with deep regret that we are canceling this year’s party. ” “As Hillary said in her concession speech: ‘Let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come,’” the letter concluded, along with a promise of more parties in the future. The invitations to the bash, printed up before Election Day on November 8, had featured a caricature of Clinton wearing a red Santa hat and captioned with the words, “Make America Merry Again. ” The invitation called for guests to come dressed “patridiotically. ” LaForce  —   which includes among its clients such big names as Target, Banana Republic, Swarovski and Perry Ellis  —   had reportedly planned to incorporate nude male models painted with    body paint at the party. Now, the firm will instead donate the money meant for the party to progressive groups including Planned Parenthood, Housing Works and the Stonewall Foundation. “We just decided we couldn’t go through with it,” James LaForce told the Post.

            "Message:  Egyptian Cop’s Conviction Overturned In Protester’s Death Captured On Camera  Egypt’s top court on Sunday overturned the conviction of a police officer jailed for manslaughter over the death of a   protester shot dead during a demonstration in January 2015. Socialist Popular Alliance Party activist Shaimaa Sabbagh was killed when she was struck by birdshot as police broke up a demonstration to mark the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak. She had been marching to lay flowers and wreaths at Tahrir Square, the focal point of the   revolution. Photographs of Sabbagh’s death were widely shared and caused outrage both internationally and within Egypt. Authorities initially denied any role in Sabbagh’s death, but months later Egypt’s public prosector took the rare move of charging a member of the security forces. Yassin Hatem Salah Eddin was sentenced in June to 15 years in prison, the Associated Press reported. But on Sunday, Egypt’s top Court of Cassation annulled the sentence and ordered a new trial be held, according to the   MENA news agency. The officer’s defense attorney had argued the protesters had gathered in defiance of a law that banned street demonstrations, and caused a scene of confusion. A small group of protesters gathered on a bridge in Cairo on Sunday to protest against the decision, according to photos captured by a Reuters photographer. The demonstrators held signs of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   and Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim that featured the word “killer” written over a splatter of blood.  \n",

            "Message: The real issue with another Phil Jackson agitation Forget for a second whether Phil Jackson understands how loaded the word “posse” is, and that    —   and most NBA players  —   when Jackson used it in an interview to describe James’ closest associates. A full lifetime in and around professional basketball suggests  —   insists  —   that Jackson is sensitive to the   with whom he played, for whom he coached, with whom he is friends. Jackson has been in the NBA since 1967. That’s 49 years for someone  —   for anyone  —   to have produced any evidence that he has even one racist tendon in his body. So let’s agree, for now, that he simply misspoke. Here are the more pressing questions anyway: Why speak at all about LeBron James, who is precisely the kind of rarefied talent that Jackson used to be so adept at aligning himself with? Why speak at all about Pat Riley, who made the transition from Hall of Fame coach to championship executive, a reality that has to drive Jackson crazy every day he watches the Knicks scuffle? Those   on Wednesday. “I don’t even know how that conversation even came up,’’ Anthony said. “I don’t know the conversation or even why Phil was talking about LeBron in the first place. I don’t think we play them anytime soon. It’s a whole month away. I just don’t understand Phil talking about LeBron right now. In November. I don’t understand that. ” Add it to the list of things that Jackson has done in his three years as a Knicks suit, three years in which he has promised so much and delivered so little. Jackson, of course, is certainly free to offer his thoughts on the world at large any time he wants to. The First Amendment is a wonderful thing. Still, you would think the subject that should be occupying his thoughts right now wouldn’t be demeaning the sport’s surpassing superstar or diminishing the one man who can be considered a contemporary to him. You would think the Knicks would be the only thing on his mind: how they can fulfill his vision of Garden restoration, how good can Kristaps Porzingis be, how much does Derrick Rose have left in the tank   …     Of course, the last time he bothered to share any of these thoughts with the local media, for whom such subjects are essential, was Sept. 22. This, despite his   promise to be as open and transparent as a pane of glass. Funny thing, too: When Jackson confines himself to the Knicks, he possibly opens himself up to criticism, given his first two years on the job, given the inconsistent way the team has performed through 10 games this year. What he doesn’t do is make himself look petty,  . And what he doesn’t do is make himself look out of touch (at best) when talking about James’ band of friends. “Anybody would understand,’’ Anthony said Tuesday, explaining why “posse’’ could be interpreted offensively. “I don’t think you have to be a rocket scientist or educated person to know what that means to us. ” And you don’t have to be a shrink to realize that Phil Jackson is distracted, at a time when there should be but one thing on his plate. He is paid $12 million a year to figure out a way to make the Knicks winners again, to make them matter again, not to be a gadfly, not to be a dull edge of the basketball cognoscenti. He should understand that by now. You wonder if he ever will. Or even wants to.\n",

            "Message: Russia Stirs Friction in Balkans, as NATO Keeps an Uneasy Peace  ZVECAN, Kosovo  —   In the densely forested mountains along the contested frontier between Serbia and Kosovo, a patrol of American soldiers under NATO command trudged through snow and mud, keeping an eye out for smugglers or anyone else trying to cross the border. Given the bloody legacy of this area, the situation is quiet now, at least up here. It is down below, in Serbia and Kosovo, where old angers are resurfacing as the Balkan region that spawned so much suffering over the last century is again becoming dangerously restive. And once again, Russia is stoking tensions, as it seeks to exploit political fissures in an area that was once viewed as a triumph of muscular American diplomacy  —   but that now underscores the growing challenges facing NATO and the European Union. “Russia sees the West meddling in its backyard, and President Vladimir V. Putin wants to show he can reciprocate,” said Dimitar Bechev, an expert on Russia and the Balkans and head of the European Policy Institute in Sofia, Bulgaria. “They see the Balkans as the West’s underbelly, and they use it to throw their weight around and project power on the cheap. ” Nearly 18 years after a United   intervention ended Serb domination of Kosovo, the border patrols are part of the   mission in NATO history. Even as the European Union has made limited progress in brokering a political settlement between Kosovo and Serbia, the presence of NATO forces has maintained an uneasy peace, with animosity between the minority Serbs and majority Albanian inhabitants of Kosovo still palpable. Yet NATO is now confronting its own challenges, whether it is the seeming ambivalence of President Trump toward the alliance or an increasingly provocative Russia. The alliance has sent reinforcements to Poland and the Baltic States to counter Russian actions, but Russian involvement in the Balkans has gotten less attention. Russia has deep historical ties with Serbia and vehemently opposed NATO’s war over Kosovo in 1999. After an   bombing campaign, Serbia lost control over the region but continues to support Serbs there, vowing never to recognize the sovereignty of Kosovo, which it considers the cradle of the Serbian nation and of its Christian Orthodox faith. Mr. Putin has continued to back Serbia, as well as Serbs living in Bosnia and Herzegovina  —   and continued to dabble in the complex swirl of Balkan politics. For starters, Moscow supported Bosnian Serbs when they held a controversial referendum in November that could lead to more  —   or even full  —   independence from Sarajevo. A month later, Russia backed fringe opposition parties in delicate national elections in Macedonia, another former Yugoslav republic. The European Union had organized the election to help bring the country back from the brink of collapse. In Montenegro, Serbia’s tiny neighbor and a former Russian ally now set to join NATO, the authorities said they had foiled an October coup attempt that had been orchestrated by the Russians. Then in January, Moscow moved to help Serbia undermine Kosovo’s independence by supporting a series of provocations that have damaged diplomatic normalization efforts, known as the Brussels dialogue, that are sponsored by the European Union. That process had recently produced a small breakthrough, as Kosovo was about to get its own +383 calling code. Since Kosovo declared independence in 2008, however, the ethnic   government in the capital, Pristina, has failed to bring the predominantly Serb parts of the country north of the Ibar River under its control, including Mitrovica. But as Kosovars were celebrating this breakthrough, the Serbs erected a concrete wall separating the northern, predominantly Serb part of Mitrovica from the ethnic Albanians in the southern part. It was built on the Serbian side of the bridge that crosses the Ibar, a project that the European Union funded in hopes of linking the divided communities. European Union officials furiously demanded that the wall come down, but the Serbs remained defiant, forcing the official inauguration of the bridge to be postponed. This month, concrete blocks of the wall were bulldozed, but a metal barrier is still standing, blocking traffic and pedestrians. Most inflammatory, the Serbian government sent a   train from Belgrade to Mitrovica, adorning its coaches with signs declaring that “Kosovo is Serbia” in more than 20 languages. Kosovo stopped the train at the border, accusing Serbia of wanting to stage an invasion of northern Kosovo, modeled on Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Serbia, in turn, accused ethnic Albanians of laying mines along the railway tracks and planning a bombing campaign of Serbs and their holy sites. Serbia’s president, Tomislav Nikolic, who is thought to be backed by Russia as he seeks a second   term in the April election, threatened to send his troops back to Kosovo to protect the Serbs, if necessary. “If Serbs are killed, we’ll send the army to Kosovo,” Mr. Nikolic said after the train episode, which was ostensibly intended to restore a line that had been disconnected since the 1999 NATO bombing of the area. He warned officials in Pristina against attempting to provoke a conflict, saying it would “end badly. ” Russia’s ambassador to Serbia, Aleksandr Chepurin, wrote in a recent editorial in Serbia’s daily Politika that Moscow would support “Serbia in preventing attempts to create an artificial   of Kosovo. ” Milan Nic, a Balkan analyst at the GlobSec Policy Institute, a think tank in Bratislava, Slovakia, said that tough statements on Kosovo were common during Serbian elections but that Serbia could never improve relations with the European Union, let alone join it, by clinging to its former southern province. “If they truly want to improve lives of Serbs in Serbia,” Mr. Nic said, “they do need to give up on this illusion. ” Col. Corwin Lusk, the American commander of NATO’s multinational battle group in eastern Kosovo, agreed that the Serbian elections were fueling the angrier statements and that Russia was playing games, though he was skeptical that Moscow wanted a direct confrontation in the Balkans. “It would be very irrational behavior because it’s a fight they could not win,” he said. “It’s a fight nobody would walk away from without scars and bruises. ” Many ethnic Albanians and Serbs living in Kosovo fear another round of war. Roughly 120, 000 Serbs live in northern Kosovo, near the Serbian border, and mostly embrace the nationalistic fervor of Belgrade. But there are 70, 000 other Serbs scattered in southern Kosovo who feel more exposed to retaliation. In the town of Decani, in southwest Kosovo, 20 Serbian monks are holed up a   Serbian Orthodox monastery, which is recognized as a Unesco world heritage site and is being protected by NATO troops to prevent assaults from  . The abbot of the monastery, Father Sava Janjic, said the nationalistic talk from Serbia “often comes back to us like a boomerang. ” “Every time they call me from Serbia, they ask: ‘Is there war? Are they trying to kill you? ’’’ said Father Janjic, 52. “I tell them, ‘No, they are not.’ There is no war. I can’t lie. But the situation is far from rosy. ” NATO’s task in the region is deeply complex. Troop levels have dropped to about 5, 000 over the past decade, including 650 American soldiers, and their job includes border patrols as well as navigating the sensitivities of an ethnically divided region. In the absence of an army of their own, most ethnic Albanians see NATO troops as protectors of their state in Kosovo. “They are here to defend us from the Serbs when they want to storm back,” said Belkiza Sahatqiu, 46, a mother of three, who works in a shoe store in the   of Mitrovica. Many Serbs living in Kosovo, however, describe the alliance’s forces as occupiers more than protectors, said Lilijana Milic, who owns a farm along the highway between Mitrovica and Pristina. “They are not protecting anybody, certainly not us,” she said. “They came to occupy this land, and now they sit in their bases. Where were they when people were chased out of their homes in broad daylight?” At the same time, Ms. Milic blamed Serbian politicians in Belgrade for the misfortune of Kosovo’s Serbs. “They just talk, talk, talk, talk about defending us,” she said, “but all they ever do is take care of their own interests. ”\n",

            "Message: Drone smashes through woman’s apartment window A GoPro drone crashed through a Manhattan woman’s   window and landed just feet from her as she sat in her living room enjoying a quiet evening at home, police sources said Sunday. The    resident was working on her computer inside the East River   when the hobby craft smashed through the window at around 5:45 p. m. according to the sources. The     device  —   which has a   propeller and a camera  —   landed on the floor just 4 feet away from her, cops said. “Poor lady. She’s lucky she wasn’t killed,” said Stephanie Bowden, 23, who was visiting her boyfriend’s apartment 11 floors below at the time. Police on Sunday were investigating who owns the drone, a   2.  GoPro Karma Quadcopter model, and where it came from. The Federal Aviation Administration also plans to look into it, police sources said. If the owner registered the device with the FAA  —   which is legally required for recreational drones between . 55 and 55 pounds  —   it can be traced back to the owner, sources said. Police also may be able to use a serial number located on the base and battery of the drone to track down who it belongs to, sources said. Flying drones recreationally is banned in Manhattan and nearly everywhere else in the city, except in five   parks, according to the Parks Department. Drones are forbidden fewer than five miles from JFK or LaGuardia airports in any direction under federal aviation law. The FAA offers other “guidelines,” too, noting that the gadgets should not be flown near buildings and bridges or more than 400 feet in the air. The    victim of Saturday’s bizarre accident declined comment to The Post  —   but stunned neighbors at her building at 20 Waterside Plaza said it takes home intrusion to new heights. Nick Ward, 24, a project engineer who lives on 30th floor, said, “That’s pretty crazy. I’d say the statistics for this happening are really, really low. ” Bowden added, “The last thing you expect is for something to come crashing through the window. “I can’t imagine how scary that must have been. ’’ Drones have caused other problems in the Big Apple. Last year, a    video maker was arrested for accidentally flying a drone into the Empire State Building. In July, a    man also was busted flying the gadget 20 feet below a passenger jet as it was landing at JFK Airport. And in May 2015, a graffiti “artist” used a drone to   a   Calvin Klein billboard in Soho. A rep for GoPro didn’t return a request for comment Sunday.\n",

            "Message: Apple chief: driverless car venture is ‘the mother of all AI projects’ Apple has shed new light on its   driverless car project, as chief executive Tim Cook described the challenge of building autonomous vehicles as “the mother of all” artificial intelligence projects. Cook said Apple was ploughing resources into developing technology to control driverless vehicles, although he refused to rule out the Silicon Valley firm building its own car at some point. The Apple boss spoke as shares in his company and other US tech firms came under pressure this week amid investor concerns that a   boom is losing steam. Cook attempted to restore faith in Apple’s ability to strike out into new territory by giving his most detailed comments yet about a car venture that has been shrouded in secrecy.  “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” said Cook in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “Clearly one purpose of autonomous systems is   cars. There are others. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI [artificial intelligence] projects. ” He added: “It’s probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on. ” When reports of Apple’s interest in cars started to emerge in the media, it was initially thought that the company was going to challenged the automotive giants of Detroit, which are racing to build their own   cars. But the spectrum of Apple’s ambitions narrowed last year after Apple veteran Bob Mansfield was put in charge of the programme, dubbed Project Titan. While Cook was cagey about how Project Titan will evolve, his comments suggest that Apple’s primary focus is on AI technology that could be sold or adapted for use in other industries. “We’re not really saying from a product point of view what we will do, but we are being straightforward that it’s a core technology that we view as very important,” said Cook. David Bailey, a motor industry expert at Aston University in Birmingham, said Apple’s ability to come up with   products, such as the iPhone, iPad and iPod, could give it an edge over rivals. “They can offer a number of things such as the software systems that enable the tech to function but also making that extremely friendly for a passenger in a way that other tech companies haven’t been able to do. ” He added: “Autonomous systems can open up mobility to people who don’t use cars but it needs to be accessible and  . Apple’s expertise is in that area, they have a knack of making something intuitively very easy to use. ” Dr Nick Reed, academy director at transport research group TRL, said Apple was smart to focus on technology rather than going    with car manufacturers. “It would be difficult for them to revolutionise the production of cars but in use and operations, there’s a great opportunity. Their strength is in integration with digital lifestyle  —   a seamless experience, whether it’s at home, on your desktop, or your smartphone or now in your car. ” One analyst said Apple may have abandoned plans to build a car after realising it was lagging behind   rivals. “They were slow to begin testing autonomous systems, and they now have a considerable innovation gap to close,” said James Hodgson of tech consultancy ABI Research. “Previous attempts by Apple to address personal mobility and automation have been marred by high turnover in specialist staff. ” Referring to reports that Apple had attempted to form alliances with two German carmakers, Hodgson added: “In addition, previous talks with BMW and Daimler allegedly broke down over data protection and control. It seems Apple has decided that developing their own autonomous system is preferable to partnering. ” Silicon Valley’s other behemoth, Google parent company Alphabet, has also shifted the focus of its driverless vehicle plans towards technology for installation in cars built by established automotive firms. The company’s Waymo division confirmed on Monday it is phasing out its “Firefly” bubble car and has instead sought to highlight its partnership on the Chrysler Pacifica minivan. YooJung Ahn, lead industrial designer and Jaime Waydo, lead systems engineer for Waymo, said in a blogpost: “Now that we’ve moved to our next phase  —   letting members of the public use our   cars in their daily lives  —   we’re ready to retire our fleet of Fireflies and focus on integrating our latest technology into vehicles like our new   Chrysler Pacifica minivan. ”\n",

            "Message: Trump’s Good — and Lawful — Move to Nullify the Clean Power Plan Fantasy On Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order nullifying the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, a piece of   regulation that was probably illegal and certainly unwise. Democrats are howling and no doubt will sue. Live by executive action, die by executive action: If the Democrats want the Clean Power Plan to be enshrined in law, then they should consider passing a law, or at least trying to. As someone once said, “elections have consequences. ” The Clean Power Plan is the result of a cascade of legal and policy errors, one in which the Supreme Court itself is culpable. The Clean Air Act could be amended in Congress, but, instead, a coalition of largely Democratic states went to court to force the Environmental Protection Agency to classify carbon dioxide as a source of air pollution under the Clean Air Act, which would oblige the EPA to come up with a plan for regulating it. The case was Massachusetts v. EPA (2007) and the Supreme Court decided it wrongly, issuing a 5 —  4 decision that obliged the EPA to treat carbon dioxide as a source of air pollution under the assumption that climate change “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. ” Under that standard, we might well regulate Boko Haram as a source of air pollution. The ruling came in spite of the fact that the EPA itself had previously determined that it had no authority to issue carbon dioxide regulations under the Clean Air Act and a dozen other narrower legal considerations. Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissent is worth taking the time to read. Scott Pruitt, the new administrator of the EPA, was one of those attorneys general. And he repeatedly has made it clear that one of his priorities at the EPA will be to ensure that the agency abides by the rule of law rather than engage in regulatory adventuring with dubious authority. “Does EPA even possess the tools, under the Clean Air Act, to address this?” he asks. “It’s a fair question to ask if we do, or whether there in fact needs to be a congressional response to the climate issue. ” Here Pruitt is stating something that is, strangely, as controversial as it is obvious: If we are to make climate change a priority of the U. S. government, then Congress needs to pass a law establishing what that means and how we are to proceed. This is a question for elected officials, not for cloistered, unaccountable regulators. Indeed, even those who prefer a more aggressive approach to climate change concede that the Clean Air Act is hardly a sufficient legislative basis for national action. The EPA itself believes this, and testified to that fact in a subsequent Supreme Court case, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (2014). The Democrats already have indicated that they will go to court and argue that President Trump does not have the executive authority to reverse a program instituted on the executive authority of the previous administration. Their argument is unpersuasive. There are of course limits to what the president may do domestically (thanks for that, Mr. Madison). But forging the enforcement of a regulatory scheme hatched by the prior administration  —   one that never has been enforced and that the current administration and half the states plausibly believe to be illegal  —   falls well within the proper discretion of the executive. We are not convinced that immediate and radical action on climate change is either necessary or prudent. But if there is to be such action, it should come from an elected Congress, an elected president, or both. It is not as though Democrats have not run on the issue  —   they simply have been unsuccessful doing so. They ought to heed Barack Obama’s advice: “Win an election. ” Donald Trump won the last one. And on the matter of EPA overreach, he is doing the lawful thing and the right thing. \n",

            "Message: New Hampshire’s Many Late-Deciders Shift GOP Rankings in Final Hours  According to all recent polling, Donald Trump enjoys a big lead in New Hampshire’s Republican race, with four or five other candidates battling for place and show. [But voters in New Hampshire, like Iowa, are famous for putting off their final voting decision until the very end.  In both 2008 and 2012, around 20 percent of New Hampshire Republican primary voters decided on election day which candidate to support. Including the weekend before the primary election, that number increases to 40 percent of the electorate. One reason polling was so off in Iowa is that 45 percent of   made their final decision in the days leading up to the caucus. Cruz and Rubio essentially tied among these voters, both beating Trump by   margins. Trump crushed Rubio among voters who decided whom to support much earlier in the campaign. This allowed him to hold onto second place over a   Rubio. History provides a cautionary note for Trump heading into the New Hampshire vote. Although Mitt Romney led in all Granite State polling in 2012, his margin among late deciders was much smaller than his overall winning percentage. Romney won the overall state by 16 points, but he won   by only 8 points. In 2008, Romney led polling in the state throughout the campaign until the final few weeks. McCain went into the election with a slim lead in polling. McCain won, largely because   broke for him decisively. In that election, 50 percent of Republican primary voters decided within the last week of the campaign. Based on these two elections and the recent vote in the Iowa caucus, expect   to break for one of the candidates other than Donald Trump. Like Romney in 2012, Trump may ultimately win the   but it will be by a much smaller margin than he currently enjoys in the polls. Polling in New Hampshire this year has been very steady at the top of the race. For at least a month, and in recent daily tracking polls, Trump has been polling around 30 percent support. The volitility has been for second and third place, with polls showing each of the other major candidates in second or third. The volatility is now producing a series of sharply different polls  —   an Exeter University released Monday has Jeb Bush at 16 percent, Sen. Marco Rubio at 12 percent and Trump at 31 percent. The stakes are different for the various candidates. If Bush, John Kasich or Chris Christie don’t finish in either the second or third spot, their candidacies are effectively over. Each have wagered enormous finanical resources and personal campaign time in the Granite State. Jeb Bush is still airing more TV advertising than any other Presidential candidate, including Democrats. Marco Rubio is airing the second most ads of any Republican candidate, so the stakes have been raised for him as well. Finishing a strong third in Iowa, Rubio entered the final stretch before the New Hampshire vote with   momentum. This earned media and his robust advertising in New Hampshire positioned him to run a close second to Trump, with a possibility of competing to win. Polling over the last week, however, has shown very little movement to Rubio. His disastrous performance in Saturday’s debate will further blunt any momentum he may have once enjoyed. He has the resources to continue campaigning beyond New Hampshire, but his hope to consolidate the “mainstream” Republican vote behind him will be on hold unless he finishes a strong second. Ted Cruz has the least to lose in the vote Tuesday. Having already won the Iowa caucus, he has his ticket to compete in the later contests. With evangelicals only making up around 20 percent of the Republican electorate in New Hampshire, Cruz hasn’t campaigned in the state as aggressively as he did in Iowa. He seems to have moved most of his campaign infrastructure to South Carolina, which votes on February 20th. There are two big variables in New Hampshire tomorrow that go beyond the regular political considerations. First, the state is expecting a   storm on Tuesday. This will likely have an impact on turnout, which will give an edge to the campaigns with the most organization turnout effort. Finally, New Hampshire allows anyone to vote in a primary. Independents make up the largest block of voters in the state, by a wide margin. How many of these decide to vote in the Republican, rather than Democrat primary will have a big impact. Trump runs better with moderate voters, so a surge in Independents should help him. In 2012, just 53 percent of voters in the primary were registered Republicans. In 2008, however, 61 percent of primary voters were registered Republicans. Mitt Romney won among Republicans in 2008, but lost Independents, and the state, to John McCain. There is one final variable. Donald Trump hasn’t employed the kind of ground game traditionally used by campaigns in either Iowa or New Hampshire. He has staked his campaign generally on earned media and large rallies. He has done more retail,   campaigning in New Hampshire recently, but still isn’t employing the kind of voter identification and turnout operation in use by other campaigns. Whether this will work in the end is perhaps the greatest unknown. Trump currently leads all rivals by   margins. In some polls, in fact, he has double the support of his nearest rival. Late deciders, however, will make this race much closer in the end.\n",

            "Message: Comey lays out the case that Trump obstructed justice  A Senate committee on Thursday heard former FBI director James B. Comey essentially lay out an obstruction of justice case against President Trump as he highlighted critical encounters that will be part of any evaluation of whether Trump committed a crime. There was evidence of possible intent: when the president cleared the room so he could ask Comey  —   without the attorney general or his    present  —   about the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russian officials after the 2016 election.  There was the suggestion of quid pro quo: when Trump repeatedly raised the status of Comey’s job as he asked for loyalty.  And there was the consequence: when Comey, having not steered investigators away from Flynn, was fired by Trump in May, long before the end of his   term. Comey, a former prosecutor, did not connect those dots explicitly to allege obstruction. But he posited someone who might.       (Bastien   Washington Post)   “I don’t think it’s for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct,” Comey said. “I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work towards, to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that’s an offense. ”  Robert S. Mueller III, another former FBI director, was appointed special counsel last month and heads the independent investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.  Legal analysts said Comey’s testimony clarified and bolstered the case that the president obstructed justice  —   adding rich new color about the former FBI director’s interactions with the president.  It might not be the last word. Trump’s personal lawyer disputed key portions of Comey’s   account, and the president has hinted on Twitter he might have “tapes” of what happened. But Comey said he kept contemporaneous memos, which he was willing to see released. He also said he would not stand in the way of the president’s purported recordings also becoming public.  “Release all the tapes,” Comey said. “I’m good with it. ”  Comey’s testimony was remarkable for its frankness, and for his willingness to reveal his personal reactions to the president along with his view of the facts. Comey said Trump’s request that he terminate the Flynn investigation left him “stunned,” and it sparked serious conversations among senior leaders at the FBI about what to do next.  “It was of investigative interest to us to try and figure out what just happened with the president’s request,” Comey said.       (Jenny   Washington Post)    [7 takeaways from Comey’s extraordinary testimony]  Of particular concern, Comey said, was that Trump asked other officials to leave him alone with his FBI director in the Oval Office before saying of Flynn: “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. ”  “Why did he kick everybody out of the Oval Office?” Comey said. “That, to me as an investigator, is a very significant fact. ” Kelly Kramer, a   criminal defense attorney at the Mayer Brown law firm, said that point was particularly damaging.  “I think any reasonable prosecutor would look at that and say it implies a consciousness of guilt,” Kramer said. “You know this is not something you’re supposed to be doing. You’re not even willing to do it in front of the attorney general. ” Marc E. Kasowitz, Trump’s lawyer, disputed Comey’s descriptions of Trump’s interactions with the president and said Trump “never pressured Mr. Comey. ” Kasowitz said Trump never “directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone,” and he said Trump specifically “never suggested that Mr. Comey ‘let Flynn go.’ ” “As the president publicly stated the next day, he did say to Mr. Comey, ‘General Flynn is a good guy, he has been through a lot’ and also ‘asked how General Flynn is doing,’ ” Kasowitz said.  Comey testified that he was skeptical of Trump almost from the outset, and he decided to document their interactions because he was “concerned [Trump] might lie about the nature of our meeting. ”   [Comey testifies: Former FBI director says he helped reveal details of conversations with Trump]  He said his concerns were realized almost immediately. In a meeting soon after Trump took office, Comey said, Trump brought up his job as FBI director and asked for loyalty. Comey said he felt Trump was “looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job. ” The FBI director is generally appointed to a   term to avoid political influence. Kasowitz said the president “never told Mr. Comey, ‘I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.’ He never said it in form, and he never said it in substance. ” The next month, after a counterterrorism briefing, Comey testified that Trump asked him to stay for a    conversation. He said both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump’s    and close adviser, Jared Kushner, lingered behind  —   in Comey’s view, because they were leery of what might happen next.  When they left, Comey said, Trump said he hoped Comey would shut down an investigation of Flynn. At the time, Comey said, Flynn was “in legal jeopardy,” as agents were investigating him for his contacts with Russians and “whether there were false statements made to government investigators. ”  Under questioning from Sen. Richard Burr ( . C.) Comey denied that Trump had asked him to stop the FBI investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 U. S. elections. But he said the Flynn request was nonetheless “very disturbing” and that other bureau officials were “as shocked and troubled by it as I was. ”  Comey also said he believed he was fired to affect the Russia probe.  “It’s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,” Comey said. “I was fired, in some way, to change  —   or the endeavor was to change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted. ” Comey allowed, under questioning from Sen. James E. Risch ( ) that Trump did not outright give him an order on Flynn.  “He did not direct you to let it go?” Risch asked.  “Not in his words, no,” Comey said.  But Comey later said he took the president’s assertion as akin to a command.  “I took it as a direction,” Comey said. “This is the president of the United States, with me alone, saying ‘I hope this.’ ”  [Legal analysts: Trump might have obstructed justice, if Comey’s allegation is true]  The specific language of Trump’s request could be pivotal. In response to a question from Risch, Comey conceded he was not aware of a case where the FBI had charged someone for hoping something.  Cornell University law professor Jens David Ohlin said that he understood “why the Republicans would want to focus on ‘hope’ versus ‘direct,’ but I don’t think it makes any difference. ” “Trump made his wishes clear and fired Comey when his wishes weren’t respected,” Ohlin said. “It doesn’t matter whether it was an order or not. What matters is the action that Trump took when it became clear that Comey was continuing the investigation. ” While Mueller could ultimately conclude Trump obstructed justice, previous Justice Department legal opinions say he could not indict or charge a sitting president. Congress, though, could impeach the president. Barak Cohen, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice at Perkins Coie, said he believed Comey was “walking a fine line” by “trying to convey how he interpreted the president, but also admitting that there might have been other ways to interpret what the president said. ” But Comey’s assessment of the situation, he said, was critically important. “He was there; he heard the president’s tone and saw his body language  —   things that shape whatever the president was trying to express,” Cohen said. “That’s why direct evidence of someone who witnesses an alleged crime is so important. ”  Read more:   Comey and Trump’s interactions: what we know so far   Comey raised serious concerns about two   Justice officials   Comey shot down one media report but confirmed a bunch of others  \n",

            "Message: Kanye West Compares Himself to Trump in Mid-Concert Rant SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  —   Just days after telling fans at a concert that he would have voted for Donald Trump, Kanye West delivered another public screed Saturday night, this time about Beyoncé, Jay Z, Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg, the radio and MTV at the Sacramento, California, stop of his Saint Pablo Tour. [Captured on video by   West in an over   tirade told the audience he was on his “Trump (expletive) tonight. ” Fans in attendance said on social media that West played only a few songs before ending the show abruptly after only 30 minutes. The angry audience booed, and many are seeking refunds for the aborted show. Some paid around $250 for a pair of tickets.  The incident became a hot topic on Twitter and other social platforms Sunday morning, as amateur videos circulated of West’s rant where, among other things, he said he was hurt because he heard Beyoncé refused to perform at the MTV Video Music Awards unless she won Video of the Year over him. He also urged her husband Jay Z to call him and “talk to me like a man. ” West took aim at radio stations for playing the same stuff “over and over and over,” too and also addressed Hillary Clinton. (Strong Language) “It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world,” West said. “Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. ” The performer said he was putting his life, career and “public  ” at risk by talking to the fans in the audience “like this,” adding that his Saint Pablo tour “is the most relevant (expletive) happening. ” He continued: “I am here to change things. And things won’t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with. My vision. I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. ” West’s representatives did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n",

            "Message: Poll: High Numbers of Americans Think America in Decline Infuriated with Elites on Obamatrade, Immigration  MIAMI, Florida  —   Polling data from Caddell  Associates shows that Americans across the political spectrum are infuriated with the permanent political class pushing through trade deals that don’t serve the interests of American workers. [The online survey of 1, 950 conducted Feb. 23 to March 3, with a margin of error under 3 percent, found that 85 percent of voters rated “American jobs moving overseas because of the loss of American manufacturing” between a 6 and 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 as being an “extremely important problem. ”  The polling results were provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of their public release by Pat Caddell, along with Americans for Limited Government’s Rick Manning and Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) at a National Press Club press conference on Thursday morning. The poll comes on the day of the next GOP presidential debate in Miami. There has yet to be a single question focused on the Trans Pacific Partnership and Trade Promotion Authority in previous debates. The issue has been treated like an afterthought by the mainstream media and by the political class, despite widespread anger among the electorate at elites over it. A whopping 70 percent thought the same thing when it comes to “trade deals with other countries that make it easier to import their products into the U. S. ” The polling found similarly surprisingly high interest in controlling immigration to the United States. It found 64 percent of all voters thought the same when it comes to “increasing border security and controlling immigration. ” When it comes to wage stagnation, something both bad trade deals and endless immigration negatively affect, an astonishing 81 percent of voters rated it between a 6 and 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 when asked if “stagnation of     wages” was either an “extremely important problem” or “not at all an important problem. ” Those aren’t the only issues voters consider important.   percent rated “the budget deficit and the national debt” between 6 and 10 on that scale, as well 85 percent finding the same for “fighting ISIS and Al Qaeda terrorism. ” But the trade and immigration statistics seem to explain why political outsiders like Donald Trump in the Republican primary and Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary are succeeding —  especially in places like Michigan, where Trump and Sanders both just won big on Tuesday. Part of that, too, is that voters are feeling in their wallets and pocketbooks the disdain they think politicians in Washington, D. C. have for them.   percent of voters surveyed agreed that “the power of ordinary people to control our country is getting weaker every day, as political leaders on both sides fight to protect their own power and privilege, at the expense of the nation’s  . We need to restore what we really believe in  —   real democracy by the people and real free enterprise. ” Only 12 percent disagreed. 19 percent, meanwhile, agreed that “politicians really care about people like me” while 75 percent disagreed.   percent of voters think “powerful interests from Wall Street banks to corporations, unions and political interest groups have used campaign and lobbying money to rig the system for themselves” and that “they are looting the national treasury of billions of dollars at the expense of every man, woman and child” while only 17 percent disagreed with that statement. When asked if they agree or disagree that “political leaders are more interested in protecting their power and privilege than doing what is right for the American people,” 82 percent said they agreed while 12 percent disagreed.   percent, meanwhile, said they agreed that “America is in a state of decline” while only 25 percent disagreed. It’s so bad that 63 percent said they would vote to throw out every single member of Congress, saying they agreed that “if there was a place on my ballot where I could vote to defeat and replace every single member of Congress, including my own representative, I would do so. ” A mere 26 percent said they wouldn’t. Up and down these polling documents found similar answers no matter how questions were worded. Fifty percent replied that they think their children will find a worse off America than they currently experience, while only 23 percent think children will be better off than them. When asked if they think “there are different rules for the   and people with money,” 83 percent said yes. Only 10 percent said “everyone more or less plays by the same rules to get ahead” while 7 percent said they didn’t know. Getting back to trade policy, 72 percent said they would support significant corporate tax cuts to prevent inversions —  where companies move their operations overseas to avoid high U. S. tax rates. “Because the United States has the highest corporate tax rate, many American corporations have chosen to keep their profits overseas,” respondents were asked. “Would you favor or oppose a proposal to allow that money to be brought into the United States at a lower or no tax rate if the corporations agree to invest the great majority of that money in increasing U. S. manufacturing and adding jobs?” In response, 72 percent said they either strongly or somewhat favored it —  28 percent strongly favoring it and 44 percent somewhat favoring it —  while just 14 percent, 9 somewhat and 5 strongly, opposed it.   percent of those surveyed believe that “over the last two decades do you believe the free trade agreements signed by the United States with other countries were” more of a benefit to other nations, while just 9 percent think it benefits the U. S. more —  and 18 percent think benefits were equal while 27 percent were unsure. When asked which is more important, “protecting American jobs and industries from being outsourced to other countries” or “allowing free trade so you can buy products at low prices no matter what country they come from,” 72 percent said the former while just 16 percent said the latter and 12 percent didn’t know.   percent similarly said “protecting American jobs by raising tariffs on countries with unethical trade practices even if it harms America’s global reputation,” is more important than “fostering good relations between America and other countries through free trade agreements at the loss of some American jobs. ” Twenty percent were unsure. Vast majorities also don’t care about cheaper goods access if trade deals drain jobs out of America. “While increasing international trade has led to cheaper goods, it doesn’t matter how cheap they are if I don’t have a good paying job,” respondents were asked, to which 74 percent agreed and just 14 percent disagreed —  with 12 percent unsure. Sixty percent agreed when asked if “increasing international trade has hurt America” and that “it simply results in more and more good paying U. S. jobs moving to other countries and forcing American workers to accept lower wages in order to compete. ” Only 25 percent disagreed, and 15 percent were unsure. Seventy five percent said that they agreed “our economic and trade policies should always put American needs and American jobs first, before the needs of other countries or big corporations” while only 13 percent disagreed and 12 percent were unsure. Throughout the cross tabs, no matter how many other ways the pollsters asked similar questions, they got similarly high remarks in response. And the numbers were similar when it comes to how voters view immigration policy and how they view America’s standing in the world. On immigration, 67 percent agreed either somewhat or strongly when asked if “our immigration policies are being written by the same corporate elite that want cheap labor anywhere they can find it” and if “they send our jobs and factories overseas and at the same time want to bring   immigrant labor into our country. ” Only 18 percent disagreed, 12 somewhat and 6 strongly, while 16 percent were unsure. When asked about visas, Americans expressed widespread opposition when posed this question: “America has a special visa program that allows companies to bring in varying levels of high skilled foreign workers. Similarly they are able to bring in workers for low wage jobs. Last December behind closed doors, Congress quadrupled the amount of these kind of visas, critics were shocked saying this would only come at the expense of jobs and lower wages for American workers. Do you agree or disagree with the decision to increase the number of these visas?”   percent said they either somewhat or strongly disagree, while just 25 percent said they strongly or somewhat agree and 16 percent didn’t know.   percent of Americans believe that “in the 15 years since   do you think the power and prestige of the United States as an international leader and power” has declined while only 9 percent believe it has increased. A quarter think it has remained the same, and 9 percent don’t know.\n",

            "Message: Ted Cruz Defends Colorado ’Election’: ’65,000 Voted’  Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) defended the controversial Colorado Republican delegate selection process on Monday in two rally speeches in southern California as he kicked off his campaign in the Golden State. [In a morning address in Irvine, and an evening rally in San Diego, Cruz fired up hundreds of fans, activists and delegate candidates, touting his jobs, freedom, and security policies, and taking shots at Democrats Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( )  But Cruz also defended the Colorado delegate selection process, which rival and frontrunner Donald Trump attacked as part of a “rigged system. ” On Monday evening, Cruz referenced his landslide win in Utah, his delegate win in North Dakota, and his surge in the Wisconsin primary. He also boasted about sweeping delegate wins in Colorado, including victories in seven districts and at the state level: Now you may have noticed that when Donald loses he yells and screams and stamps his foot, he curses and yells to anyone nearby. Look we know in the state of California, wine is best served with cheese. And Donald has this very odd thing, so Colorado, he’s been on TV all day long, saying Colorado was terrible they stole the election. Donald, 65, 000 people voted in the state of Colorado, they just didn’t vote for you, they voted for our campaign. To put it more simply Donald  —   it ain’t stealing when the voters vote against you. It is the voters reclaiming this country and reclaiming sanity. The “voting” process to which Cruz referred involved the selection of state delegates, starting at the precinct level. Last year, the state party chose to cancel the traditional voting process for the 2016 election  —   the only state party to do so.  In Irvine on Monday morning, Cruz also referred to the Colorado process as an “election”: “In the last three weeks, we have beaten Donald Trump in all eleven elections,” he told an enthusiastic crowd, including Colorado in his list. In 2012 approximately 66, 000 Coloradans voted in the Republican caucuses, according to the New York Times. In 2008 approximately 70, 000 Republican voters turned out for the primary caucuses. On Monday, Trump took to Twitter, criticizing the Colorado GOP’s delegate process. He hit on the issue again at an evening campaign rally in Albany, New York saying, “It’s a totally corrupt, rigged system. ” Trump proclaimed that in Colorado, “They took away their votes. ” Colorado Senator Cory Gardner also took to Twitter on Monday, but to defend the Colorado GOP’s primary process. IN both Irvine and San Diego, Cruz claimed he was the best candidate to defeat Clinton, citing a Fox News poll showing that he is beating the former Secretary of State 47 to 44. He also highlighted his lead over Clinton “with young people by 14 points. ” He took a shot at Clinton over her email scandal: “I do have good news for Hillary’s legal team. Going forward Hillary is going to be able to use any server she wants because she will never again be an employee of the United States government. ” Cruz has quietly been spending time in California in recent weeks, meeting with delegates and raising funds and rallying support. Monday marked the emphatic start of his campaign for California’s 172 Republican delegates. He hopes to stop Trump from winning an overall majority of 1, 237, and to force a contested convention. He told the crowd gathered in San Diego that for the first time in decades, “California is gonna decide the Republican presidential candidate. ” The Texas senator emphasized many of his familiar campaign trail talking points on jobs, freedom, and security. “People of California, y’all are paying the price for having the highest taxes in the country, for having the worst regulatory regime in the country, for causing small businesses to flee this country, but let me tell you this, in 2017 we’re gonna pull the boot of Washington off of California  …    ”. San Diego is home to a significant military and veteran population, and Cruz ramped up the San Diego audience when he crescendoed on the use of military force. “Americans have always been reluctant to use military force. We are slow to anger. We believe in peace through strength. But if and when military force is necessary, we should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and then get the heck out. ” The packed banquet room, where local Republicans had gathered for the party    rally, hosted scores of enthusiastic Cruz supporters as well as some Trump fans. Throughout the Cruz speech the crowd would break out in boisterous chanting. Republican Party of San Diego County Chairman Tony Krvaric told Breitbart News, “We invited all three candidates and were thrilled when Senator Cruz accepted our invitation to address San Diego County Republicans. 2, 000 tickets were snapped up in less than 18 hours an over 1, 000 attendees were wait listed for what turned out to be our biggest event ever. ” Krvaric highlighted the local party’s websites for each of the three remaining candidates  —   Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich  —   that give volunteers a place to connect with the campaign of their choice. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana \n",

In operations areas water has come through the ceiling resulting in large puddles on the floor around cabling and wiring. ” Adding insult to injury, according to an ESPN report, Friday a fire started in rubbish in the underground parking structure forcing 100 Australian team members to vacate their section of Olympic Village. Although no one was injured by the fire, when the athletes returned to their rooms they discovered two laptops and several team shirts stolen. \n",

            "Message: Russia intervened to help Trump win election: intelligence officials  U. S. intelligence analysts have concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help   Donald Trump win the White House, and not just to undermine confidence in the U. S. electoral system, a senior U. S. official said on Friday.  U. S. intelligence agencies have assessed that as the 2016 presidential campaign progressed, Russian government officials devoted increasing attention to assisting Trump’s effort to win the election, the U. S. official familiar with the finding told Reuters on Friday night, speaking on condition of anonymity. The  ’s transition office released a statement that exaggerated his margin of victory and attacked the U. S. intelligence community that Trump will soon command, but did not address the analysts’ conclusion. ”These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction,” the statement said. ”The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and ’Make America Great Again. ’” Democrats and some Republicans in Congress are calling for a full investigation into Russia’s election year activities. ”Protecting the integrity of our elections is hindered when   Trump and his transition team minimize or dismiss the intelligence assessments themselves,” Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said in a statement issued on Saturday.     Citing U. S. officials briefed on the matter, the Washington Post reported on Friday that intelligence agencies had identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, to WikiLeaks. U. S. President Barack Obama has ordered intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention into the 2016 election and deliver a report before he leaves office on Jan. 20, the White House said on Friday. Obama’s homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters the report’s results would be shared with lawmakers and others. ”The president has directed the intelligence community to conduct a full review of what happened during the 2016 election process . .. and to capture lessons learned from that and to report to a range of stakeholders, to include the Congress,” she said during an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. As summer turned to fall, Russian hackers turned almost all their attention to the Democrats. Virtually all the emails they released publicly were potentially damaging to Clinton and the Democrats, not Republicans, the official told Reuters. ”That was a major clue to their intent,” the official said. ”If all they wanted to do was discredit our political system, why publicize the failings of just one party, especially when you have a target like Trump?” A second official familiar with the report said the intelligence analysts’ conclusion about Russia’s motives does not mean the intelligence community believes that Moscow’s efforts altered or significantly affected the outcome of the election. Russian officials have denied all accusations of interference in the U. S. election. A Central Intelligence Agency spokeswoman said the agency had no comment on the matter. The hacked emails passed to WikiLeaks were a regular source of embarrassment to the Clinton campaign during the race for the presidency. U. S. intelligence analysts have assessed ”with high confidence” that at some point in the extended presidential campaign Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government had decided to try to bolster Trump’s chances of winning. The Russians appear to have concluded that Trump had a shot at winning and that he would be much friendlier to Russia than Clinton would be, especially on issues such as maintaining economic sanctions and imposing additional ones, the official said.  Moscow is launching a similar effort to influence the next German election, following an escalating campaign to promote   and nationalist political parties and individuals in Europe that began more than a decade ago, the official said. In both cases, said the official, Putin’s campaigns in both Europe and the United States are intended to disrupt and discredit the Western concept of democracy by promoting extremist candidates, parties, and political figures. In October, the U. S. government publicly accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama has said he warned Putin about consequences for the attacks.  ”I don’t believe they interfered,” Trump told Time magazine about Russia in an interview published this week. ”That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say, ’Oh, Russia interfered. ’”  (Writing by David Alexander and John Walcott; Additional reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee, Wis.; Editing by Louise Heavens and Matthew Lewis) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ”declaration of war” which could trigger clashes within days. CARACAS   government supporters burst into Venezuela’s   congress on Wednesday, witnesses said, attacking and besieging lawmakers in the latest   of violence during a political crisis. \n",

            "Message: 3 Trump Cabinet officials will still be receiving millions from corporate America  At least three of Donald Trump’s Cabinet officials are receiving   payouts  —     “golden parachutes”  —   from the companies they are leaving to join the federal government.    Exxon Mobil will pay Rex Tillerson, its former CEO, a compensation package worth $180 million after he becomes secretary of state. Elaine Chao will receive between $1 million and $5 million from the bank Wells Fargo on her way to oversee Trump’s transportation department. Goldman Sachs will award Gary Cohn, incoming chair of the National Economic Council, close to $285 million. Democrats have said these “golden parachutes” are a form of corruption  —   payments from corporations seeking to win favor with new government regulators. Progressives in the Senate, like Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin, criticized President Barack Obama on the same grounds when he also nominated bank executives who were taking payments from their former employers.  The banks offering the parachutes, and the officials receiving them, call those charges wildly misleading. They say the payments are necessary to separate new government officials from their existing company holdings (like stocks) rather than amounting to any kind of special gift.    Independent experts in campaign finance disagree. ”The point here is obviously for the business to try to befriend the regulator so he or she goes soft on them,” says Craig Holman, legal counsel at the    advocacy firm Public Citizen. “This really ought to outrage everybody. ”    Rex Tillerson’s “golden parachute” In blasting Tillerson, some media outlets have taken to implying that Exxon is showering the incoming secretary of state with additional cash simply because he’s joining the government. “Rex Tillerson will make another $180 million if confirmed as Trump’s secretary of state,” wrote Mic’s Jack Buehrer. The reality is more complicated: Tillerson is receiving the $180 million primarily because he’s accumulated more than 2 million restricted shares of stock and restricted stock units in years leading the company.    Obviously, nobody would argue that it’d be more ethical for Tillerson to keep his Exxon stock options while secretary of state  —   where he could potentially use the office to increase their value. The controversy instead comes in when we consider how Exxon and Tillerson agreed to separate his financial holdings. Exxon’s company policy bans its employees from immediately cashing out on their stocks. To get around that problem, the plan is for Exxon to have Tillerson receive $180 million from an independent trust  —   one that will pay him over the next 10 years. That arrangement was brokered by the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, which signed off on the deal. Some experts, like ethics lawyer Stan Brand, have argued that Exxon’s independent trust is in line with company policy. Brand told Bloomberg that since Tillerson’s won’t be able to immediately receive all the funds in the independent trust, the stocks were not being allocated to Tillerson on an “accelerated schedule” in defiance of company policy. Therefore, Brand said, the fund doesn’t amount to any kind of special gift.    But critics say Exxon still appears to be going out of its way to help Tillerson with a special exemption. Alan Johnson, a compensation consultant in New York, told Bloomberg that Exxon was deviating from its normal practice “of not delivering stock early” because the independent trust allows Tillerson to immediately separate from Exxon.  That makes it look like Exxon is making a special exception to give Tillerson access to $180 million, right before he helms a government agency that could deliver huge financial rewards to Exxon. Exxon drills for oil and gas on six separate continents, and government agencies under the control of Tillerson’s state department  —   like the Bureau of Energy Resources  —   are directly involved in managing the natural resources of foreign countries, according to Bloomberg. (That state department agency, for instance, helps the South American country of Guyana manage its resources  —   and Exxon owns nearly half of a 1. 4 billion barrel oil field in the country.) Chao and Cohn are explicitly being rewarded for taking government jobs Chao and Cohn pose a different problem in the eyes of ethics advocates. That’s because, unlike Tillerson, they both have provisions in their contracts that specifically require their companies to reward them with millions if they join the government, according to Holman, of Public Citizen. They would not receive these payouts if they left their companies either to retire or to join a competitor. We only know this kind of arrangement exists on Wall Street because of President Obama’s Cabinet. During Jack Lew’s Senate confirmation hearing for Treasury secretary in 2013, he revealed that he received $1 million in payments from Citibank in order to join the Obama administration. Further reporting revealed that Lew’s contract contained a clause directly stating that the $1 million bonus was contingent on him taking a “ ” government position, according to the Intercept’s Lee Fang. Lew wouldn’t have received that amount if he’d instead gone to work for a competitor or retired. “The point here is clearly to buy favor with the regulator,” Holman says. “If you can give the new person in the administration $1 million on their way out, the idea is that they’ll then represent your point of view in the government. ”    The idea of a “golden parachute” as a retirement or bonus package for a leaving employee is nothing new. But the revelation about Lew and Citigroup hinted at something much more suspicious  —   that big financial firms weren’t just generously compensating outgoing employees, but that they were explicitly rewarding them for joining the government. That shocked experts, since it suggested that these government officials were taking huge sums of money not because of their work as private regulators but because they had become government officials. “Only in the Wonderland of Wall Street logic could one argue that this looks like anything other than a bribe,” Sheila Bair, then the chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said in a statement at the time. At first, the Wall Street banks maintained that Lew’s arrangement was an exception. “They were saying it’s a   deal and that nobody really did it,” Holman says. “And then we found out it was fairly common. ” A company filing from Morgan Stanley revealed its executives are eligible for a bonus if they work for “a governmental department or agency,   agency, or other public service employer. ” Stanley Fischer, now vice chair of the Federal Reserve, had a similar clause in his Citigroup contract, according to a report by Public Citizen. Antonio Weiss, a counselor to Lew, admitted that Weiss received $21 million from the bank Lazard for entering the government, according to a report by David Dayen in the New Republic. The public never saw the actual text of his contract, Dayen reported. Holman says Chao and Cohn’s financial disclosure forms reveal that the practice is continuing into the Trump administration  —   at least for those two nominees, and possibly others.    We have no idea how many other nominations will have the same problem Tillerson’s $180 million, Chao’s $5 million, Cohn’s $285 million  —   these are just the Trump Cabinet business conflicts we know about. It’s certainly possible that there are others. The reason for the mystery is that Trump’s nominees have refused to release documentation we’d need to know if there are more of these kinds of payments going on.  This has been the core of some Senate Democrats’ response to news of the “golden parachutes” being deployed on behalf of Trump’s Cabinet. In a letter released on January 14, seven Democratic senators requested Trump’s incoming nominees disclose what money they’d be receiving that they wouldn’t be getting if they were going to another private sector job or retiring. “We ask that any compensation provided to a nominee  —   that would be otherwise forfeited  —   be explicitly described in financial disclosure documents submitted to the Senate,” they wrote. On Tuesday, Wisconsin’s Baldwin reintroduced legislation that would also make the kind of agreement between Cohn and Goldman Sachs illegal  —   it would ban employers from paying bonuses to employers when they join the government. (The legislation is likely headed nowhere.)  “When Wall Street insiders and corporate executives move through the revolving door from the private sector to public service, they should not be rewarded with golden parachutes simply for joining the Trump Administration,” Baldwin said in a statement to Vox. Correction: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Jack Lew received $21 million from the Lazard financial firm. In fact, Antonio Weiss received $21 million from the Lazard firm. \n",

            "Message: Ben Carson, tasked with helping the poor, believes poverty is ’a state of mind’ Poverty is largely “a state of mind” housing secretary Ben Carson has claimed, dismaying observers who had modest hopes for his tenure. Carson, the neurosurgeon who heads the agency charged with helping   Americans gain access to affordable housing, told Sirius XM radio: “You take somebody who has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they’ll be right back up there. ” He went on: “And you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they’ll work their way back down to the bottom. ” Poverty and homelessness experts were quick to condemn the remarks. “Every time he says something like this it suggests to me that the mindset of the secretary is just completely out of line with the mission of he department that he’s been selected to run,” Fred Karnas, a senior housing and urban development (HUD) official in the Clinton and Obama administrations, told the Guardian. Karnas said he had had felt “cautious optimism” when Carson was confirmed  —   former colleagues of his had met Carson to discuss redressing housing discrimination, and expected pushback, but the conversations went well. But he said he was “appalled” by Carson’s latest remarks. The real roots of poverty, Karnas said, “are related to access to employment, access to quality education, obviously racism”. This disappointment in Carson was echoed by Diane Yentel, head of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. After Carson’s confirmation hearing in January, Yentel said the new housing secretary had “clearly taken the time to begin to understand and come to appreciate the importance of HUD’s programs”. In response to his comments yesterday, however, she criticized his “tired  offensive cliches” in a tweet. Robert Reich, the secretary of labor under Bill Clinton, tweeted: “So 15 million American children in poverty just need better attitudes and they’ll have food in their stomachs and roofs over their heads?” Carson’s comments were not the only cause for concern for those working on   issues this week. The Trump administration’s 2018 budget calls for cuts of $6. 2bn, or 13. 2% to HUD, alongside deep reductions in expenditures on Medicaid and food stamps. Although Congress will ultimately come up with its own spending plan, the president’s budget is taken as a reflection of his philosophy and priorities.  Carson did not seem fazed by the possible slimming down of his agency. The budget proposal “reflects this administration’s commitment to fiscal responsibility while continuing HUD’s core support of our most vulnerable households” he said in a statement, and states, local governments and the private sector were intended to pick up the slack. Carson was always an unlikely choice for his job. His experience in government is essentially limited to his 2016 presidential candidacy, and he is known for zany pronouncements  —   for instance, that the pyramids were grain storehouses rather than pharaonic tombs. This seemed of little concern to his supporters during his confirmation hearing, Senator Mike Rounds said that “probably running this department is not really brain surgery. ” Still, Carson’s hardscrabble upbringing  —   an adviser said his “mother worked three jobs at a time to keep them out of public housing”  —   and his medical background had suggested to some that he might bring empathy and a valuable perspective to the role. For one man currently experiencing poverty, Carson’s charge about his mental state rankles. “I challenge Ben Carson or anyone of his choosing with the ‘right mindset’ to step into my life on the streets,” said Brett Anderson, a homeless man who resides with his family in an RV in San Francisco. It would not be so easy, he said, to find a way out.\n",

The fatally injured greater   guenons were discovered in their exhibit  this week, said Sam Winslow, the zoo’s assistant director.      “The keepers came in that morning and found the monkeys basically chewed up by some dogs,” Winslow said. “They were inside their enclosure still. ”  Winslow said the guenons, which weighed about 20 to 25 pounds each, were “pretty aggressive. ” Officials believe they might have reached out from their cage, prompting the attack. “So we suspect that the dogs went up to them and the monkeys tried to reach out and grab the dogs, and then got their arms caught by the dogs,” he said.  A    female monkey, a    male and    male all died of their injuries, the Advocate reported. According to the newspaper, two were dead when they were discovered by the keepers, and one needed to be euthanized. Officials have reviewed surveillance footage from a nearby concession stand that shows two dogs in the area, according to Winslow.   [‘It could have been very bad’: Gorilla killed after boy falls into Cincinnati zoo exhibit]   Winslow said officials have yet to track down the dogs, which appear to be terriers. They did review their perimeter fence in the wake of the attack, to try to figure out how the dogs entered the facility. “It’s hard to blame the dogs for this. It’s really the irresponsible pet owners that let their dogs go out at random,” Winslow said. “These didn’t look like they were starving strays. They were probably someone’s house pet. People turn their dogs out at night  —   they get into trouble, and they cause damage, whether it be with cats, or other dogs, or children, even. So it’s really irresponsible pet owners that are to blame for this. ” Winslow said officials aren’t sure exactly when the attack took place, but the footage captured the dogs in the zoo at around 5 a. m.  Tuesday. “All we could find is at one gate, there was a gap that was probably about four to six inches, where two gates come together, and they may have gotten through there,” he said. “That’s what we supposed anyway, we really can’t  —   don’t know for sure. It’s a pretty small gap. ”   [The rumors of this panda’s death were greatly exaggerated]   The greater   guenon is found in Africa, and are known for their color patterns. The three that were attacked were the only greater   guenons housed in the Baton Rouge facility,  Winslow said. No other monkeys were injured in the encounter. “It was surprising for us, because we typically keep all of our smaller animals secured at night, because we have a lot of raccoons and such, that come into our zoo,” Winslow said. “So we secure a lot of those animals. So we’re surprised at something like that, that an animal that’s in an enclosure would be able to be attacked by dogs. ” The Advocate notes that this isn’t the first fatal dog attack at the Baton Rouge facility. Dogs also killed 17 flamingos in a 2010 incident. Read More: Zoos are built for people. Animals need sanctuaries instead. Zoos are too important to fail.

            "Message: Anderson Cooper absolutely grilled Florida’s GOP attorney general over her support for LGBT people  CNN’s Anderson Cooper went after Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) hard in a    interview Tuesday, calling into question her status as a champion for LGBT Floridians given her work on the legal fight against   marriage in the state. And for five minutes, he didn’t relent. Cooper began the interview by quoting Bondi as saying that anybody who attacks Florida’s LGBT community will be gone after ”to the fullest extent of the law.” The quote    and Tuesday afternoon’s interview    were both in regard to the terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning. Cooper then noted that many people in the LGBT community he spoke to did not have much regard for Bondi, given her work against   marriage in the state. Bondi notably, in 2014, wrote in court papers that Florida allowing the recognition of   marriages performed in other states would ”impose significant public harm.” (Cooper used the words ”induce public harm. ”) That’s when things got heated. ”Do you really think you’re a champion of the gay community?” he asked. Bondi emphasized that she was sworn to uphold the Constitution of Florida and that Florida voters had passed a ban on   marriage (it passed with 62 percent support in 2008). ”It had nothing to do    I’ve never said I don’t like gay people,” Bondi protested. ”That’s ridiculous.” Cooper, who in 2012 came out as gay, didn’t back down, though, focusing on the use of the word ”harm” in the court papers. ”Doesn’t that send a message to some people who might have bad ideas in mind?” he asked. ”Anderson, I don’t believe gay people could do harm to the state of Florida,” Bondi said. Then Cooper asked again. And again. By the end, he’d asked some version of that question five times. A visibly frustrated Bondi sighed and said she would also defend a law legalizing marijuana if it were the law of Florida. Cooper then went deeper. He asked twice about whether there was a ”sick irony” that Bondi fought against something that would allow for the loved ones of the victims in Orlando to be notified of what happened and allowed to visit them in the hospital, and the two engaged in a    over the state fighting against a federal judge who struck down the state’s   marriage law. Eventually, Bondi tried to steer things away from that territory, but Cooper wouldn’t let her. ”You know what today’s about? Human beings,” Bondi said. ”Today’s about victims.” Cooper interjected: ”It’s about gay and lesbian victims.” ”It sure is,” Bondi said. ”LGBT victims.”       Cooper then again asked whether Bondi is being a ”hyprocrite” by portraying herself as a champion of gay people, before making perhaps his most brutal comment: ”It’s just that    I will say I have never seen you talk about gays and lesbians and transgender people in a positive way until now.” Bondi responded by noting that her website now has an image of   hands clasped together. ”So you just put that up now?” Cooper said. ”Yeah, I did,” Bondi said. ”After this horrible tragedy, absolutely.” The two ended with a handshake that neither of them really seemed to want to take part in.

            "Message: U.S. Carries Out Strikes Against Yemen’s Rebels  The U. S. launched missiles at three radar installations in   areas of Yemen late Wednesday. It’s the first time that the U. S. has carried out strikes against the Houthi rebels during the conflict in Yemen. This comes after missiles were fired from Yemen’s coast at U. S. Navy destroyer USS Mason on two separate occasions in four days. The ship was able to deploy ”defensive countermeasures,” according to a statement from Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook, and there was ”no damage to the ship or its crew.” A U. S. official told NPR’s Tom Bowman that the destroyer USS Nitze launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at the three locations, located north of a strategic strait called Bab  . ”Initial assessments indicated that all three targets were destroyed,” he tells Tom. The Pentagon says that these strikes make it ”much harder for these Houthi rebels to actually target any ship out in the Red Sea,” as Tom reported on Morning Edition. He added that Pentagon officials said there was ”no sense .. of any civilians being killed.” Meanwhile, Yemen’s state news agency SABA  —   which is under Houthi control  —   denied that a U. S. warship was targeted. A ”military official” called the allegations a pretext for the ”  coalition to escalate their aggression attacks against Yemen.” The Shiite Houthi rebels are backed by Iran and fighting alongside military units loyal to Yemen’s former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. They took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in late 2015 and seized large swaths of territory. The war escalated in March 2015 when a   coalition began an air campaign aimed at pushing the rebels back into their northern stronghold. This coalition supports Yemen’s   exiled leader Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The war has killed almost 10, 000 people  —   and according to the U. N. some 4, 000 of those killed are civilians. The   coalition has repeatedly been accused of causing civilian casualties, including an incident over the weekend where at least 140 civilians were killed while attending a funeral in Sanaa. The U. S. provides crucial support to the   coalition. As Tom explains, it is ”providing air refueling capability, intelligence capability as well, and they’ve refueled as many as 5, 000 flights  —   bombing flights  —   over Yemen.” Pentagon officials are referring to Wednesday’s Tomahawk missile launches as ”limited  ” strikes, Tom said. He added that ”I don’t think they would say they’re involved in a civil war, but clearly they’re being dragged in.” Here’s more from Tom: ”I think the U. S. would like to see some sort of a resolution here, but of course, once you start striking rebel areas, it makes it hard for you to be an honest broker here. But there’s a growing concern, though, over the increasing civilian toll here  —   and there’s a lot of concern in Congress about that in particular.” The U. S. said earlier this week that it was reconsidering its support for the   coalition, as NPR’s Jackie Northam reported. She added that the White House said the ”  security arrangement with the Saudis is not a blank check.”\n",

            "Message: The un-American Captain America  ”It’s impossible to watch Captain America: Civil War and root for Tony   Man,” writes my colleague Alex  .    Challenge accepted! I watched Captain America: Civil War and rooted for Iron Man. But let me go further: I watched Captain America: Civil War and rooted against Captain America. His position was, quite simply,  . A quick recap for those unfamiliar with the films or who didn’t pay   attention to the expository dialogue (spoilers follow, obviously): Captain America leads a team of (mostly) superhuman warriors who possess the power to level cities, topple governments, and create   AIs. Yes, they’ve saved the world (see the first Avengers movie) but they’ve also imperiled it (see the second Avengers movie). It’s canonical that the state holds a monopoly on the use of major force. And so the governments of the world eventually decide, reasonably enough, that the Avengers need some oversight: They propose placing them under United Nations auspices, and suggest that the team could only be deployed amidst international agreement.    I can imagine plenty of arguments against this arrangement. The UN is a bureaucratic mess, and I’m not sure it makes sense for the Avengers to be subject to Russia’s veto. Perhaps the Avengers should be part of America’s arsenal instead  —   their oversight could come from a special congressional committee, or a branch of the military.    But Captain America’s position is that the Avengers  should have   …     no oversight at all. Cap, you see, prefers to place his faith in people, not institutions or governments. He was friends with Bucky Barnes as a kid, and so he knows that Bucky  —   despite his   interregnum as a brainwashed Soviet soldier  —   couldn’t have detonated that bomb. And what, he asks, happens if the UN tells the Avengers to go somewhere they don’t want to go, or to avoid a fight they want to join? What’s striking about this position is how fundamentally   it is, on two levels.    The first is that America is a country that rejects placing unlimited faith in extraordinary individuals as opposed to (often cumbersome!) institutions and processes. We broke away from a monarchy, and we revere George Washington for stepping back from the presidency. We’ve created a political system so pockmarked with checks, balances, and veto points that even our most powerful, skilled, popular leaders can only expect to accomplish a fraction of their agenda. We built, by world standards, an unusually weak presidency, and then we further amended the Constitution to limit presidents to two terms. Then, as we grew into the greatest superpower the world has ever known, we decided that the best way to legitimize our might would be to voluntarily constrain ourselves within a web of multilateral institutions. Yes, there are examples of unilateralism in our history, but even George W. Bush’s ”coalition of the willing” was a coalition, and involved extensive UN consultation, in an effort to legitimize our actions. Far from seeing the limits and compromises of institutions like NATO and the UN as corrupting, strengthening those institutions has been the core of America’s post —  World War II foreign policy. The counterargument here could be America’s gun culture. Don’t we revere the Second Amendment? Don’t we permit citizens to stockpile individual arsenals? We do, and in the comic version of Civil War, there was an analogy to be made: There, the Superhero Registration Act meant every powered person had to register with the government, sign up for training, and so on.    But in the film, all that falls away. As I understand it, the Avengers are allowed to simply stop being Avengers if they don’t want oversight  —   Cap can keep his shield, Black Widow can keep her stingers, Iron Man can keep his suit, and they can go on and live normal lives. What they can’t do is act as vigilantes. That’s more or less the equilibrium in America, too, where we let people possess   amounts of weaponry but have pretty strict laws about whom they’re able to shoot. What Iron Man is advocating is a system based on America’s traditions: our skepticism of imbuing individuals with unrestrained authority, our belief that great strength needs to be legitimized through process and restraint, and our faith that a cumbersome political process is preferable to the mistakes made when passion meets power. In response, Cap says he prefers that the only restraint he trusts or even accepts is his own conscience. I recognize the majority of Cap’s life was spent before the end of World War II, but that’s not how America has seen its role in the world for a long, long time. So, yes, I rooted for Tony Stark in his fight against Captain America. But I only did it because I’m a patriot.  Watch: We’ve hit peak lens flare. Here’s how it started.    \n",

            "Message: Oil edges down as traders weigh U.S. stock build, OPEC cuts  Oil prices ended less than 1 percent lower on Wednesday after data showed a build in U. S. crude inventories, reinforcing the view that oil prices are range bound, buoyed by expected OPEC production cuts while pressured by U. S. output growth. U. S. crude futures for March delivery CLc1 settled at $52. 75 a barrel, down 43 cents, after earlier dropping to as low as $52. 56 per barrel. Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 36 cents a barrel at $55. 08.  ”Crude oil is in the middle of a trading range that began to unfold in early December,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at ICAP. ”You have a market with a serious case of indigestion, it swallowed too much speculative length.”   Market expectations of output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have provided a floor for prices, while extreme speculative length and looming U. S. production growth provide a ceiling, he said.     The U. S. government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that crude, gasoline and diesel stockpiles rose, confirming a report from the American Petroleum Institute trade group late on Tuesday. [ ] [ ] The EIA data, however, showed a substantial build in gasoline stockpiles of 6. 8 million barrels, exceeding analyst expectations and figures in the API report. U. S. gasoline crack spreads, or refining margins   hit a session low of $12. 20 a barrel after the data was released, the lowest since Dec. 14.  Oil prices have found support in recent weeks from plans by OPEC and other producers to cut output. Around 1. 5 million barrels per day (bpd) has already been cut from the market out of the 1. 8 million bpd agreed by major producers starting on Jan. 1, energy ministers said on Sunday. Bernstein Energy said global oil inventories declined by 24 million barrels to 5. 7 billion barrels in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the previous quarter. The amount remaining equates to about 60 days of world oil consumption. Meanwhile, U. S. oil production has risen more than 6 percent since   yet it remains 7 percent below its 2015 peak. Output is back to levels reached in late 2014, when strong U. S. production contributed to a crash in crude prices. President Donald Trump’s promise to support the U. S. oil industry has encouraged analysts to revise up their forecasts of growth in domestic oil production, which is already benefiting from higher prices. A push by Republicans in the U. S. House of Representatives for a shift to a   corporate tax could help propel U. S. crude prices higher than global benchmark Brent, triggering   domestic production, Goldman Sachs said.

            "Message: El Chapo’s sons likely behind deadly ambush on Mexican army convoy MEXICO CITY  —   The sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman were likely behind a brazen ambush on a military convoy using grenades and   guns that left five soldiers dead and 10 wounded on Friday, officials said. The attack in Mexico’s northern Sinaloa state left two military vehicles completely burned out and dead soldiers scattered across a highway. It was apparently launched to free a wounded drug suspect being transported in an ambulance guarded by the convoy. “Up this point we are not certain about this group, but it is very probable that it was the sons of Chapo,” said local military commander Gen. Alfonso Duarte. The   ambush was the worst attack on military personnel since 2015, when drug cartel gunmen in the state of Jalisco shot down an army helicopter with a rocket launcher, killing 10 people. Friday’s attack on the outskirts of Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, was unusual for the Sinaloa cartel, which Guzman headed until he was   in January. Some believe his sons are now running the gang and have changed the rules of engagement long practiced by the father, who kept a low profile until last year. However others say “El Chapo’s” longtime partner Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada is in control. The fierceness of the attack suggested that whoever was travelling in the ambulance escorted by the convoy was a   member of the cartel, or a person of interest to the gang. “These groups acted with cowardice, in a premeditated manner, and the carried out the attack with weapons, with grenades,” while the soldiers had only automatic weapons, said Duarte. Duarte said the attack was launched to free the suspect, who he identified as Julio Oscar Ortiz Vega, though he acknowledged the name might be a pseudonym. Duarte said the wounded man had been picked up by soldiers following a gun fight in Badiraguato, Guzman’s hometown. Duarte said that Guzman’s brother, known by his nickname as “El Guano,” has been fighting a turf battle against the Beltran Leyva cartel in the area “to control the means of drug production,” which include opium poppy fields. The Defense Department said in a statement that an army patrol had been attacked in Badiraguato and returned fire; the wounded man was taken into custody when the rest of the attackers fled. Because local hospitals couldn’t give him the care he needed, an army patrol was taking him to Culiacan when it came under attack. The attackers took the ambulance and the wounded suspect before fleeing. Among those wounded in the convoy were the ambulance driver and one soldier who suffered severe injuries. Meanwhile, authorities in Jalisco said Thursday they have found a total of nine bodies near a lake popular with tourists. Jalisco state Attorney General Eduardo Almaguer said the bodies of eight men and one woman have not yet been identified, in part because of the rural nature of the area and the lack of witnesses. The bodies have been found over the last few days in a river that leads out of the eastern end of Lake Chapala, near the border with the state of Michoacan. In 2013, 64 bodies were found in mass graves in area nearby. That is the opposite end of the lake from the town of Chapala, popular among tourists and American retirees.\n",

            "Message: Bill Paxton, Star of ‘Big Love’ and Movie Blockbusters, Dies at 61  Bill Paxton, the affable actor who was a   in a string of 1990s blockbuster movies including “Twister,” “Titanic” and “Apollo 13,” and who later played the lead in the critically acclaimed television drama “Big Love,” has died. He was 61. His death, from complications of surgery, was announced on Sunday by a family representative. The statement did not say when or where Mr. Paxton died, but Rolling Stone magazine reported that he died on Saturday. Early in his career, Mr. Paxton had small parts in “The Terminator” (1984) and “Aliens” (1986). Both films were directed by James Cameron, who later featured him in more   roles: as a   salesman who cheated Jamie Lee Curtis’s character in “True Lies” (1994) and as the   scientist who salvaged the wreck of the ocean liner in “Titanic” (1997). He also starred in Ron Howard’s   film “Apollo 13” (1995) portraying Fred Haise, one of three astronauts on a mission to the moon that experienced serious mechanical problems, and in “Twister” (1996) as a  . Mr. Paxton appeared regularly on television in the last decade. On the HBO series “Big Love,” from 2006 to 2011, he played Bill Henrickson, the patriarch of a polygamist family in Utah, receiving three Golden Globe nominations for his portrayal. In 2012, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for playing Randolph McCoy in the     “Hatfields  McCoys” on the History Channel. And in 2014 he appeared in six episodes of “Marvel’s Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. ” on ABC. Mr. Paxton returned to TV this year as the star of “Training Day,” CBS’s new police drama. A spinoff of the 2001 movie starring Denzel Washington, the series had its premiere this month, and only four episodes have been broadcast. In total, 13 episodes of “Training Day” have been filmed, and Mr. Paxton appears in all of them. For now, the show will continue to be shown on Thursday nights, but its future is not certain. Reviews have been mixed  —   though Mr. Paxton’s performance as a rogue cop has been praised  —   and its ratings have been low, averaging little more than four million viewers. In a statement, CBS and Warner Bros. Television offered no word on the show’s future. William Paxton was born on May 17, 1955, in Fort Worth, the son of the former Mary Lou Gray and John Lane Paxton, a businessman and sometime actor. When he was 8, Bill and his brother, Bob, were taken by their father to see President John F. Kennedy on the morning of Nov. 22, 1963, in Fort Worth, hours before his assassination in Dallas. “I remember just a really euphoric crowd,” he recalled in a 2013 interview. “I was a bit young to really understand later the consequences of the event. ” There is a photograph of Mr. Paxton from that morning, perched on a stranger’s shoulders. He graduated from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth and moved to Los Angeles the next year to break into the film industry, finding jobs as a production assistant and set dresser. At 21 he enrolled in New York University, where he studied with the acting teacher Stella Adler, but dropped out after two years to return to Los Angeles to pursue acting there. “I didn’t see any point in a degree,” he told Texas Monthly. “I didn’t see where I’d be filling that in on an application for any kind of job. ” Mr. Paxton’s survivors include his wife of more than 30 years, Louise Newbury and two children, James and Lydia. Long before his role in “Big Love,’’ Mr. Paxton was   in assessing his status in Hollywood. “It’s always a little frustrating when you’re reading a script after 10 guys ahead of you have had a chance to pick it over,” he said in 1998. “You can almost see the bread crumbs. I haven’t had a role that’s propelled me into major stardom. Sure, I’ve had roles that put me on the playing field. A lot of base hits. No home runs. ”\n",

            "Message: A Clue in the Mystery of Van Gogh’s Ear    I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. NEWS BRIEF The story of how Vincent Van Gogh sliced off his ear has always held more than a few mysteries. It was 1888, and he had moved to Arles, France, to start a collective for artists. Paul Gauguin had joined Van Gogh there, and one night in December the two argued —   —  though about what is a mystery. Van Gogh held a razor, and he possibly attacked Gauguin (or perhaps Gauguin attacked him) then in a fit of anger, depression, or hallucination, Van Gogh lopped off part of his ear, wrapped it in cloth, then handed it to a prostitute at a brothel. Among all the unknowns of this story, and Van Gogh’s life, is just how much of his ear he lost that night. It was long believed Van Gogh cut off the bottom part, just the lobe. This Friday, a new exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in the Netherlands features a drawing made in 1930 by a doctor who treated the artist. That drawing suggests Van Gogh sliced off nearly his whole ear. The exhibition is called “On the Verge of Insanity,” and it follows the Dutch painter’s collapse into mental illness, the story of his mutilated ear, and his eventual suicide. One of the exhibit’s most hyped pieces is the drawing by Felix Rey, the young French doctor, which, as the Associated Press tweeted, looked like this: Sketch by a junior provincial doctor offers evidence that painter Vincent Van Gogh cut off nearly all his ear. https:  .  According to Rey’s drawing, all that remained of Van Gogh’s ear seemed to be a tiny flap of lobe —   —  quite the opposite of what everyone has thought. Two people deserve credit for its discovery. One was Irving Stone, an author, who asked Rey to draw him the picture during his research for a book on Van Gogh’s life. The other person who deserves credit is writer Bernadette Murphy, who rediscovered it in Stone’s archive at the University of California, Berkley’s library. For those obsessed with Van Gogh, or just morbidly curious, another item featured at the exhibit is a 7mm pocket revolver.

            "Message: Chico State Athletic Program: Don’t Say Offensive Words Like ‘Coward’ and ‘Spaz’ California State University, Chico’s athletic program has launched a “We Don’t Say” initiative instructing players not to use words like “coward” or “spaz” to ensure “care and inclusivity. ” Other   phrases include “just kill me,” “you’re a failure,” and “like a girl,” as well as blatantly offensive words like “whore,” “n*****” and “f***. ” First of all, let me just say that a campaign including the   in the same group as the word “coward” is absurd. What’s more, printing posters telling students not to say “n*****” is obviously a waste of ink, seeing as literally no one is under the impression that busting out racial slurs and “demeaning someone based on their ethnicity” is anything but “unacceptable. ” Making posters warning against the word “coward” is a bad idea, too, but for the opposite reason: Using that word is not always clearly a bad thing. In fact, it can sometimes be helpful. For example: Someone once called me a “coward” for freaking out so badly about a spider in my shower that I didn’t want to go into the bathroom. In that situation, the person calling me a “coward” was objectively correct, and their making me aware of that fact prompted me to kill the spider, take a shower, and go on with my day. Had that person simply said well, “you can’t judge someone else by your own standards,” I might have not taken a shower  —   which would not have been good for anyone. Calling people out on how their fears might be preventing their success can be inspiring, and so the appropriateness of doing so should be assessed on a    basis. That’s how communication works  —   context is a huge part of it, and campaigns like this completely take it out of the equation. That’s not making communication better it’s making it worse. “Everyone is welcome here. We are a family. We want everyone to feel included, and we want our language to reflect that. ” More P. C. Culture   Histrionics on the LeftFinding the Roots of Violent Campus ProtestsWhy the Liberal Elite Will Never Check Its PrivilegeNow, obviously, that’s not a bad goal, but just what is the point of singling out specific hurtful words and phrases with a campaign like this? After all, there are plenty of ways to be mean beyond them. For example: “You’re a fat, stupid piece of garbage with bad hair!” and “You should have never been born!” and “I hope you die in a fire!” are also mean things to say, but they’re not included on this list. Why can’t there just be a campaign encouraging people to be nice? That would make at least some sense. Ideally, though, I’d say the best course of action would be no action at all: to trust that, by the time people reach college age, they already know that it’s better to be nice, know what kinds of things are nice, and know how to handle it when they hear something that’s not.  This story was previously covered in an article on College Fix. \n",

            "Message: CNN cancels Reza Aslan’s show after ‘piece of s–t’ Trump tweet  no longer believes in “Believer,” the   series it launched earlier this year with   the   author and religious scholar. “CNN has decided to not move forward with production on the acquired series ‘Believer with Reza Aslan,’” the network said in a statement. “We wish Reza and his production team all the best. “ Aslan came under fire earlier this month after using profanity to describe President Donald Trump in the wake of remarks the President made about the terrorist attacks on London. In the tweet, Aslan called Trump “a piece of s —  t” and expressed dismay at Trump’s use of the tragedy to promote his desire for a   “travel ban” on certain kinds of people hailing from specific countries in the Middle East. The author later apologized, saying, “I should have used better language to express my shock and frustration at the president’s lack of decorum and sympathy for the victims of London. I apologize for my choice of words. ” “Believer” would have entered a second season if it had been picked up. “Obviously I am very disappointed in this decision. ‘Believer’ means a great deal to me and to the countless viewers it’s reached. Its message of religious tolerance and exploration is extremely important right now. I am deeply grateful to CNN for giving me the opportunity to launch the show and to amplify my voice on their network. I am especially grateful to the legion of people within the Turner organization who worked so hard to make the show a hit series,” said Aslan, in a prepared statement. ” However, in these politically charged times, the tenor of our nation’s discourse has become complicated, and I recognize that CNN needs to protect its brand as an unbiased news outlet. Similarly, I need to honor my voice. I am not a journalist. I am a social commentator and scholar. And so I agree with CNN that it is best that we part ways. I look forward to partnering with another platform in the future to continue to spread my message.  I wish CNN all the best. ” CNN has had to grapple with other incidents of hosts and talent expressing political opinions. Late last month, the    network said it would no longer feature comedienne   as part of its annual New Year’s Eve broadcast, a day after pictured surfaced on social media of Griffin holding a bloody head resembling President Trump. CNN has a significant interest in maintaining a     stance to its viewers. Being   is at the root of the   network’s brand, while rivals Fox News Channel and MSNBC have allowed more partisan opinion in their   programming lineup. That positioning has been sorely tested in the wake of Donald Trump’s election, as CNN’s reporters and producers set about to investigate sundry controversies surrounding the    and his administration. It is not unusual during a regular CNN programming day to see “New Day” anchor Chris Cuomo grilling a Trump advisor in the early morning or Jake Tapper offering wry and unvarnished commentary about White House policy on his   program, “The Lead. ”  eager to find out whether remarks made by Trump suggesting CNN offered“fake news” had any sort of lasting impact on prospective viewers. “There has been no diminution whatsoever in the CNN brand,” Zucker said to reporters in February. “It’s as strong as it’s ever been. It’s incredibly trusted and we see no impact whatsoever in all of those attacks on the CNN brand. ” Aslan had been seen as a notable addition to the ranks of CNN’s various   series. He   BoomGen Studios, a production shingle centered on content from and about the Middle East, in 2006. He served as a consulting producer on the HBO drama “The Leftovers” and has penned   books such as “Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth” and “No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam. ” In episodes of “Believer,” Aslan examined various faiths and doctrines around the world, spending time with Orthodox Jews in Israel and a group of Indian cannibals who, in the series’ first episode, ate cooked human brain tissue.\n",

            "Message: Populist Outsider Geert Wilders in Combative Mood as the Netherlands Prepares to Go to the Polls The traditionally liberal Netherlands will go to the polls Wednesday morning to select new members of parliament and perhaps a new government, and   migration, Eurosceptic Geert Wilders is fighting to come out on top in a contest which has seen his ratings dented in recent weeks. [Riding high in polls that would have seen him comfortably take over 30 of the 150 seats in the Dutch parliament, leaving his Party for Freedom (PVV) the largest force in national politics, recent polls have shown his lead diminished or even wiped out by the prime minister’s government conservatives.  The elections are the first in five years since the 2012 vote which was prompted by Wilders’ PVV pulling out of an informal agreement to support the conservatives as a junior partner. If Mr. Wilders’ PVV comes out of Wednesday’s vote the largest party, it could mean a major role reversal with the conservatives joining a   coalition. However, even if Mr. Wilders’ party performs in a way analogous to President Donald J. Trump in the U. S. and Brexit in the United Kingdom to defy   bad polling to come out on top, his ambition to become prime minister could still be frustrated by a rainbow coalition of other parties uniting to keep him out of power. A   ‘purple’ coalition in Dutch parlance could see Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s conservatives or even the Socialist Party propped up by the dozen remaining smaller groups in a desperate effort to keep Wilders out, at any cost. Previous remarks by Rutte made clear he wasn’t interested in a coalition with Wilders, but the prospect of easy power without having to enter agreements with hard left parties could be too good to resist. Despite the odds to overcome, Mr. Wilders remained in a combative mood on the last day of campaigning Tuesday, telling listeners on national radio that if they wanted the country to be flooded with migrants then they should consider voting for the   green party. Mr. Wilders has also been extremely vocal on the ongoing diplomatic spat between the Netherlands and Turkey, over the presence of Turkish ministers in the country for campaign rallies. Turkey is hosting a referendum in April over expanding powers for President Erdoğan and has been extensively courting the votes of Turkish migrants in Europe who still have the ability to cast ballots in their home nation. Rhetoric between Turkey and the Netherlands has become heated, with Erdoğan going so far as to call the Dutch “Nazi remnants”. Following the remarks, Mr. Wilders demanded the government expel the Turkish ambassador, saying to do any less would be an insult to all of the Netherlands.\n",

            "Message: Will Mike Pence Be Trump’s Bridge to Democrats? Though he has not yet been installed in the Oval Office, Donald Trump has already made life fairly complex for his Republican brethren in Congress. Most recently, in an interview with the New York Times this week, Trump singlehandedly threw the GOP’s Obamacare repeal process into chaos, insisting that a repeal vote would come “probably some time next week” and a replacement “very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter. ” Neither was correct, but especially the replacement timeline: Congressional Republicans  are quietly insisting that it will be weeks before a replacement bill is ready —  maybe even months (or years! ).   Seeking an Escape Hatch From Trump’s America, The only person in the administration who seemed willing to acknowledge this reality is Vice   Mike Pence.  In a press conference earlier this month, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers, Pence said: “The architecture of the replacement of Obamacare will come together, as it should, through the legislative process in the weeks and months ahead. ” To be clear, Pence’s comments regarding the replacement timeline were made before his boss announced the “very quickly, very shortly thereafter” timeline for repeal. But Pence is a former congressman himself and knows well the realities of passing legislation —  especially in the case of Obamacare, where a replacement program will require 60 votes. In other words, Democrats will need to be part of the solution. The question is: can Mike Pence mitigate the situation —  bring his boss down to earth, and maybe even help with outreach to the opposition party? While Trump has made a point of sharing his excitements and proclivities to an almost pornographic degree —  it’s nearly impossible not to know what Trump’s opinion is on everything from Vanity Fair subscriptions to Meryl Streep to the latest season of The Apprentice —  Pence, constitutionally, remains more of a cipher. Pence no doubt favors conservative policy: his opposition to gay rights and reproductive health services are well documented, his distaste for social welfare programs equally so. But as it concerns his temperament, his negotiating style, his leadership acumen, it’s hard to know what kind of man Pence is, other than a relatively quiet one. Given Trump’s inclination towards hostility, Pence maybe the minority party’s best hope of breaking through to the White House —  just as Biden before him, Pence may be able to speak to adversaries in Congress more effectively than the president himself. In this, it’s most useful, perhaps, to ask those who have worked with him. As my colleague Yoni Appelbaum reported at the GOP convention this summer, Indiana Republicans have only glowing assessments of the former leader: “The single most important thing is how good a guy he is,” said one GOP state representative. But what of Indiana democrats —  faced with an uphill climb in a state legislature dominated by republicans? Congressional democrats will find themselves in a similar position, though in a narrower minority, and might use some guidance from those who have negotiated with Pence before. State Representative Terry Goodin, of the state’s 66th House District, was the most diplomatic of the democrats I spoke with. Goodin says he’s known the former governor for four or five years and conceded that he was “a little more proactive” with Pence than most in his party. “Even being in the minority, I’ve had more personal dealings with him,” he said, concluding nonetheless that, “the governor stands firm for some of those things he believes in. ” The best way to get an issue resolved, he advised, was to appeal to Pence’s sense of bipartisanship. “That makes it a little tastier,” said Goodin. I asked him about that appeal and how best to make it. “No different than the way you’d deal with anyone else,” said Goodin. “He’s the kind of person who is not reactive to a loud voice or a scream. Be courteous. ” This all seemed eminently   if not necessarily characteristic of the Trump administration thus far: a focus on bipartisanship, courtesy and indoor voices. But then I spoke with former Indiana Democratic Party chair Ann DeLaney, who has known Pence since his Congressional campaign in 1990. “What’s he like?” she said. “One, he’s quite personable. Two, he’s not aloof. Three, he’s easy to talk to. ” But she continued: “He doesn’t always think through the impact of what his positions will be. ” DeLaney cited Pence’s foray into the hornet’s nest over the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RIFRA) which was signed into law by Pence amid national outcry. “That was not only a PR disaster —  and permitted discrimination —   but he signed it into law as we were having the Final Four here,” Delaney recounted. “The media from all over country was here —  it got a tremendous amount of play that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. ” Pence, she said was completely caught off guard. DeLaney does not appear think particularly highly of Pence’s management skills. “He ran the governor’s office 9 to 5,” she said. “That’s hard to do. Crises don’t always occur between 9 to 5. I don’t think you can be an active Vice President and keep to that schedule. ” For Democrats eager to use Pence as a backchannel to either the administration, (in the hopes that he might take their case to the president) or his own party (in the hopes that he might broker some bipartisanship) DeLaney was fairly grim. “He’s pretty firmly an ideologue. He’ll do what he’s told,” she said. As it pertained to bringing his boss back to reality, Representative Charlie Brown, from Indiana’s 3rd House District, was not optimistic. When Pence was in the governor’s office, said Brown, “he did not want to rock the boat. ” “He doesn’t lay down the law,” added DeLaney. “He’s just not strong enough. ” Brown went further, saying that Pence had a hard time corralling even his own party, back in Indiana. “He had some tough times with his own caucus in both chambers,” said Brown. “They had a super majority and they wanted to appear to be united. ” But, he said,   problems arose, “Mainly because [Pence] put religion first. That whole debacle over RIFRA is what sunk him. They had a tiger by the tail. Those are his beliefs and you can’t take that away from him. It created havoc with business community. ” Still, members of the minority party might at least expect a less confrontational tone from the veep’s office, especially compared to what may be issuing forth from the man in the Oval Office (or his Twitter account). “He will not want confrontation on an individual level,  ” said DeLaney. “He’ll be much more ‘in sorrow than in anger.’ He’ll wring his hands, say [to democrats] I just can’t bring [the rest of my party] along —  so you’re going to have to do this. ” And according to Goodin, Pence’s decisions are usually final: “After he makes a decision, he doesn’t entertain much else. ” Ultimately, said DeLaney, Pence may not be all that constitutionally suited for the hurly burly of the Trump administration —  which, if the recent past is any indication, is likely to be a unpredictable and tumultuous ride. “He impresses me as someone who can deliver a message, speak well, hold his own in front of the mic,” she said, “but he’s much more comfortable with problems and solutions on index cards. And some of those problems and solutions don’t fit so well on index cards. ”\n",

            "Message: Amid U.S.-Mexico Strains, Tillerson And Kelly Take On ’Tough Trip’  Amid deep strains in the U. S. relationship with Mexico, a country that’s been a favorite target of President Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security chief John Kelly took part in talks in Mexico City on Thursday that were aimed at smoothing out tensions. ”That’s going to be a tough trip,” the president said Thursday morning at the White House. Some of the key issues between the two countries: immigration, border security, trade and U. S. aid to Mexico. In a Feb. 21 executive order, President Trump expanded the category of unauthorized immigrants the U. S. can deport to Mexico, including asylum seekers from other countries. Mexico’s foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, said earlier this week that Mexico ”will not accept” the U. S. immigration order. Speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, Kelly sought to allay some of Mexico’s concerns, saying twice, ”There will be no  —   repeat, no  —   mass deportations.” He added, ”There will be no use of military force in immigration operations  —   none.” Earlier in the day, in Washington, Trump had described deportations as ”a military operation.” Trump’s Feb. 21 executive order also ordered construction of a U. S.  border wall. To help pay for the wall, the president has threatened to slash aid to Mexico, much of which the U. S. delivers via the Merida Initiative, a    program whose primary purpose is to deter organized crime and bolster the rule of law. The wall wasn’t mentioned at Thursday’s press conference. Tillerson told reporters that Mexico and the U. S. need to ”modernize and strengthen our trade and energy relationship,” and Kelly emphasized the need for ”safe and secure trade.” Back in Washington, the president told a group of manufacturing CEOs the trade relationship with Mexico was ”unsustainable.” ”We have $70 billion in deficits, trade deficits, and it’s unsustainable,” the president said. ”We’re not going to let it happen. Can’t let it happen. We’re going to have a good relationship with Mexico, I hope. And if we don’t, we don’t. But we can’t let that happen.” The U. S. trade representative says the trade deficit with Mexico is $58 billion, not $70 billion. The president has called NAFTA, the landmark 1994 deal eliminating most tariffs among the U. S. Mexico and Canada, ”the worst trade deal in history” and a ”terrible disaster.” He has repeatedly vowed to renegotiate it  —   or ”terminate” it. Under the tripartite pact’s terms, the president can withdraw the U. S. unilaterally, without congressional approval, giving six months’ notice. U. S. exports to Mexico, its   trading partner, have increased by 468 percent from 1993, the year before NAFTA was signed, according to the U. S. trade representative website, accounting for nearly 16 percent of all U. S. exports in 2015. ”NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters,” a 2015 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded. ”The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U. S. economy appears to have been relatively modest.” But critics of NAFTA  —   including many U. S. unions, which opposed the deal from the start  —   argue that wages and employment have both suffered as a result of it. They’ve blamed it for trade deficits, job loss to Mexico, poor job opportunities, even illegal immigration. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that he does not foresee changes to NAFTA anytime soon, and it’s unclear what trade policies the Trump administration might pursue should there ever be a NAFTA withdrawal. But a pullout could lead to some of the very job losses Trump is trying to avoid, according to a recent report from the Center for Automotive Research. ”A wholesale withdrawal from NAFTA could set in motion a series of unintended consequences that would constrain future growth of the U. S. automotive industry,” the research firm warns. Other possible unintended consequences: A loss of nearly 5 million U. S. jobs, according to the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute. And imposing huge tariffs on Mexico could push that country into recession  —   leading, perhaps, to greater immigration pressures on the U. S.\n",

            "Message: Gene Wilder’s Understated Nuttiness  Gene Wilder was born Jerome Silberman but changed his name. With blue eyes that big, and hair that untamed, who else could he be? Gene Wildest, I suppose. But you’ve seen this man do his thing. What made him a star was the modesty of his nuttiness. You had to get a rise out of him. He didn’t come risen. Take the court sentencing from “Stir Crazy,” the 1980   smash in which he and Richard Pryor are framed for robbery and given 125 years. When Mr. Wilder hears the verdict, he pops his eyes and tilts his body forward. When he finds out that he’ll be spending more than a century behind bars, he and Pryor freak out in completely different, but utterly harmonious ways. Mr. Wilder loses his breath while shrieking and stammering, “What?” He then smiles through an explanation that this is a mistake. Pryor, meanwhile, simply uses his face, then asks, in that   Richard Pryor way, “Have you got the right case?” As Mr. Wilder hopefully repeats their characters’ names for the judge, he’s calmed down, but is obviously in shock. At some point, he exclaims, “No!” and leaves his mouth so agape that the geometry cracks you up. Mr. Wilder, who died on Monday at the age of 83, had a great face for comedy. That’s worth noting in 2016 when even the occasional faces of movie comedy tend to be more   …     usual: Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Gosling. There was no mistaking Mr. Wilder, even when it seemed like putting him in certain roles was a mistake. That’s why they put him there. Mopey gunslinger in “Blazing Saddles” or mad scientist in “Young Frankenstein” (both from 1974)? A 1977 parody of Rudolph Valentino’s   erotics in “The World’s Greatest Lover” (which he wrote and directed)? All miscast, all the funnier for it. All the stranger. Mr. Wilder’s eyes were famous. They glimmered even when  —   in, say, “The Producers” (1968) “Blazing Saddles” or “The Woman in Red” (1984)  —   he looked sad, even in the black and white of “Young Frankenstein. ” (Although, acting next to Marty Feldman or Zero Mostel he didn’t seem to have eyes at all.) But when he spoofed Valentino, he telegraphed the gag by enhancing the diameter of his eyes so that he looked more lunatic than lusty. And his Willy Wonka spent that chocolate factory tour quietly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. For one thing, he never seemed to blink. Mr. Wilder also had amazing diction. It was as crisp as a potato chip, as precise as some professors and as neat as the curls in his hair were a mess. It all came together when his characters fell apart. His performance in “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” (1971) was a master class of gradually shattering aplomb. Toward the end of the movie, when Wonka’s   overtakes him and he erupts at Charlie and his grandpa, who’ve inquired about why Charlie doesn’t win a lifetime of candy after all, Mr. Wilder’s rage struck a very young me the way “The Rite of Spring” shocked those Parisian   in 1913. What kind of monster does this to people? Some of that shock came from Mr. Wilder’s punching every word in Wonka’s tirade. “Wrong, sir! Wrong!” he shouts, and continues, “You stole   Drinks! You bumped into the ceiling, which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get . .. nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!” Then, just like that, he changes his mind. Mr. Hyde goes back to being Dr. Jekyll. And Charlie wins. Mr. Wilder made the character as unstable as he could make the protagonist of a supposed kiddie movie. But that was him in a nutshell: funny at both extremes. In “Young Frankenstein,” Mr. Wilder lies atop the monster his character has created, peeved that the creature beneath him has been aroused, not subdued as he requested. “Sedagive?” he barks, referring both to an earlier joke about a sedative and the current situation, and turning each syllable into a note of aggravated disbelief. Mr. Wilder doesn’t have many comedy descendants. He was too much of an original to copy. But there are traces of him whenever Johnny Depp wants to be funny  —   less as his version of Willy Wonka and more as Ed Wood. Mr. Wilder’s unreliable equilibrium suits Mr. Depp. And those four movies Pryor made with Mr. Wilder remain influential for how they literalized the upside of racial integration as conjoined symbiosis. In their movies, they wanted to be funny only together. Mr. Wilder made just under two dozen films in his eight decades. That’s a lot of neurosis. But his was something to celebrate. Not many other actors’ crackups could produce this much confetti.\n",

            "Message: About 12 released Guantanamo detainees implicated in attacks on Americans  The Obama administration believes that about 12 detainees released from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have launched attacks against U. S. or allied forces in Afghanistan, killing about a   Americans, according to current and former U. S. officials. In March, a senior Pentagon official made a startling admission to lawmakers when he acknowledged that former Guantanamo inmates were responsible for the deaths of Americans overseas. The official, Paul Lewis, who oversees Guantanamo issues at the Defense Department, provided no details, and the Obama administration has since declined to elaborate publicly on his statement because the intelligence behind it is classified. But The Washington Post has learned additional details about the suspected attacks, including the approximate number of detainees and victims involved and the fact that, while most of the incidents were directed at military personnel, the dead also included one American civilian: a female aid worker who died in Afghanistan in 2008. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, declined to give an exact number for Americans killed or wounded in the attacks, saying the figure is classified.  [Pentagon official: Release of Guantanamo detainees has led to American deaths]  Lewis’s statement had drawn scrutiny on Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers see the violence against Americans as further evidence that the president’s plans for closing the prison are misguided and dangerous. They also describe the administration’s unwillingness to release information about the attacks as another instance of its use of high levels of classification to avoid discussion of a politically charged issue that could heighten political opposition to its plans. One U. S. official familiar with the intelligence said that nine of the detainees suspected in the attacks are now dead or in foreign government custody. The official would not specify the exact number of detainees involved but said it was fewer than 15. All of them were released from Guantanamo Bay under the administration of George W. Bush. The official added: “Because many of these incidents were   firefights in a war zone, we cannot always distinguish whether Americans were killed by the former detainees or by others in the same fight. ” Military and intelligence officials, responding to lawmakers’ requests for more details, have provided lawmakers with a series of classified documents about the suspected attacks. One recent memo from the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) which was sent to the House Foreign Affairs Committee after Lewis’s testimony, described the attacks, named the detainees involved and provided information about the victims without giving their names. But lawmakers are prohibited from discussing the contents of that memo because of its high classification level. A similar document provided last month to the office of Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( . H.) a vocal opponent of Obama’s Guantanamo policy, was so highly classified that even her staff members with a   clearance level were unable to read it. “There appears to be a consistent and concerted effort by the Administration to prevent Americans from knowing the truth regarding the terrorist activities and affiliations of past and present Guantanamo detainees,” Ayotte wrote in a letter to Obama this week, urging him to declassify information about how many U. S. and NATO personnel have been killed by former detainees.  [Cuba wants the base at Guantanamo back. The U. S. isn’t budging.]    President Obama sent his plan to close the Guantanamo prison to Capital Hill, but the plan was met with immediate condemnation. (Jason Aldag, Julie   Washington Post)   Rep. Edward R. Royce ( .) who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has also written legislation that would require greater transparency surrounding the transfer of Guantanamo detainees. Royce and Ayotte are among the lawmakers who opposed a road map for closing the prison that the White House submitted to Congress earlier this year. That plan would require moving some detainees to U. S. prisons and resettling the rest overseas. “The administration is releasing dangerous terrorists to countries that can’t control them, and misleading Congress in the process,” Royce said in a statement. “The president should halt detainee transfers immediately and be honest with the American people. ” Just under 700 detainees have been released from Guantanamo since the prison opened in 2002; 80 inmates remain. Secrecy about the   prison, perched on an inaccessible corner of Cuba, is nothing new. The Bush administration for years refused to provide a roster of detainees until it was forced to do so in a Freedom of Information Act case in 2006. To this day, reporters have never been able to visit Camp 7, a classified facility that holds 14   detainees, including the five men on trial for organizing the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Both the Bush and Obama administrations have provided only limited information on current and former detainees; most of what the public knows about them comes from defense lawyers or from documents released by WikiLeaks. According to a 2012 report from the House Armed Services Committee, the Defense Intelligence Agency ended the practice of naming some suspected recidivists in 2009 when officials became concerned that it would endanger sources and methods. National Security Council spokesman Myles Caggins said it was difficult to discuss specific cases in detail because the information was classified. “But, again, we are committed to being forthcoming with the American people about our safe and responsible approach to Guantanamo detainee transfers, including about possible detainee   in terrorist activities,” he said. One Republican aide who has reviewed the classified material about the attacks on Americans said the information has been “grossly overclassified. ” Administration officials say that recidivism rates for released Guantanamo inmates remain far lower than those for federal offenders. According to a recent study, almost half of all federal offenders released in 2005 were “rearrested for a new crime or rearrested for a violation of supervision conditions. ” Among former Guantanamo detainees, the total number of released detainees who are suspected or confirmed of reengaging is about 30 percent, according to U. S. intelligence. Nearly 21 percent of those released prior to 2009 have reengaged in militancy, officials say, compared with about 4. 5 percent of the 158 released by Obama. Human rights activists say the statistics are suspect and cannot be verified because the administration provides almost no information about whom it is counting and why. Most of those suspected of   are Afghan, reflecting the large numbers of Afghans detained after the Sept. 11 attacks and the ongoing war there. More than 200 Afghan prisoners have been repatriated from the prison. Officials declined to identify the woman killed in Afghanistan in 2008. But there are two female aid workers killed that year who might fit the description. Cydney Mizell, a    employee of the Asian Rural Life Development Foundation, was abducted in Kandahar as she drove to work. Her body was never recovered, according to a former colleague who said he was told about a month later that she had died. Another woman, Nicole Dial, 30, a Trinidadian American who worked for the International Rescue Committee, was shot and killed the same year south of Kabul, along with two colleagues. Relatives of Mizell and Dial said they have not been in touch with the FBI for years. Dial’s brother said he was unaware of a former Guantanamo detainee being involved in his sister’s killing. Mizell’s stepmother said she was never told the exact circumstances of her daughter’s death or who abducted her. “She was definitely killed,” Peggy Mizell said. “I figured she was shot. ”  Julie Tate contributed to this report. \n",

            "Message: Jail to jihad: Indonesian prisons a breeding ground for militancy  Afif was an inmate in a   Indonesian jail when he transformed from aspiring radical Islamist to soldier for Islamic State, ready to sacrifice his life for a group based thousands of miles away in the Middle East. His journey ended with his death last week on a busy intersection in central Jakarta, after the gun and suicide bomb attack he launched with three other militants that brought Islamic State’s brand of violence to Southeast Asia for the first time. Afif’s graduation from jailbird to jihadi shines a light on a prison system where staff shortages, overcrowding and corruption have allowed extremists to mingle and emerge as determined killers in the name of Islam. Security officials say Afif, also known as Sunakim, was sentenced to seven years in prison for taking part in a militant training camp in the province of Aceh, where Islam is generally practiced in a stricter form than other parts of Indonesia. Once behind bars, he refused to follow deradicalization programs, the officials added. Akbar Hadi, spokesman for the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, declined to comment on whether Afif’s activities were monitored after he was released last August.  Police said he planned the Jakarta siege with the three other attackers, one of whom was also a former convict. Four civilians died in the attack along with the militants. A report by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) last year said that 26 prisons across Indonesia housed about 270 ”convicted terrorists” but Islamic State supporters accounted for only a small minority of them. National Police Chief Badrodin Haiti told Reuters that at least five jailed militants were believed to have been in communication with the plotters in the   to the attack. COURIERS, CELL PHONES While inside Jakarta’s Cipinang prison, Afif was one of some 20 convicts heavily influenced by fellow convict and firebrand Islamist cleric Aman Abdurrahman, experts said. From behind bars, Abdurrahman heads an umbrella organization formed last year through an alliance of splinter groups that support Islamic State. ”They shared the same cells, they prayed together, they cooked together,” said Taufik Andrie,   executive director of the Institute for International Peacebuilding. Abdurrahman regularly spread ”takfiri” doctrine, a belief among Sunni militants who justify their violence by branding others as infidels, through his sermons and lectures. Abdurrahman was moved to a maximum security prison in Nusakambangan in Central Java in 2013, but continued to  communicate with Afif and a growing group of around 200 followers using couriers and cell phones. A lawyer for Abu Bakar Ba’asyir, another   radical inmate at Nusakambangan, told Reuters it is easy to convey messages to the outside world from inside prison. ”Any kind of visitor is allowed and even if they don’t exchange any cell phones, there is still an exchange of information and the visitor can interpret that,” said Achmad Michdan. SOCIAL MEDIA A KEY TOOL Experts say radical inmates like Abdurrahman still get away with disseminating sermons by email, Facebook, and hard copies. Despite being behind bars, Abdurrahman was able to make an online pledge of allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. ”Those with more radical thinking can also hold religious sermons on a regular basis and it is very easy to convey radical ideas to others,” said Farihin, a former militant who participated in a government deradicalization program during his time in a prison in Palu on the island of Sulawesi. Indonesia’s   chief, Saud Usman Nasution, told Reuters in November that prison officials were unable to halt this type of communication because of overcrowding. ”We are aware that there is a problem with convicts being allowed to communicate using the Internet and cell phones. There is definitely room for improvement,” said Ministry of Law and Human Rights spokesman Hadi, adding that inmates cannot be forced to join deradicalization programs. Experts say access to social media and messaging apps like Telegram is a large part of the problem. Police believe the alleged mastermind of the Jakarta attack, an Indonesian fighting with Islamic State in Syria called Bahrun Naim, used social media to communicate his radical ideas to followers in Indonesia. He may also have transferred thousands of dollars to accounts here, police said. Since the attack, Indonesia has blocked websites and sent letters to social media networks Twitter, Facebook and Telegram, asking them to take down radical content.

            "Message: Snyder Administration Wants 1,000 New Jobs In Flint FLINT, Mich. (AP)  —   Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration has a goal of creating 1, 000 new jobs in Flint as a way of helping recover from the ongoing crisis sparked by lead in the city’s water. Officials in Snyder’s administration discussed the jobs goal Friday in a meeting of the governor’s Flint Water Interagency Task Force, The Detroit News (”major auto suppliers” about bringing jobs to the city. He told committee members that a   agreement meant that he couldn’t name the companies. Baird also said that his team and Michigan Works! are working to identify 500 ”workforce development jobs” that he said are designed to provide   positions and remove obstacles in employment, such as not having access to transportation or child care. ”Mission Flint is really all about the   prosperous, sustained recovery,” Baird, a Flint native, said in reference to the group of top state officials he leads that was formed to help the city make its water safe again and improve the struggling economy in the city. Flint, with a population of about 100, 000, had switched from Detroit’s water system to the Flint River as a way to save money until a new pipeline to Lake Huron was ready. But during those 18 months, the corrosive water leached lead from the city’s old plumbing because certain treatments weren’t added to the water. No level of lead in the human body is considered safe, especially in children. The river water also may have been a source of Legionnaires’ disease, which killed at least nine people in the region. Snyder, whose administration repeatedly downplayed the lead threat, now calls it a ”disaster.” ___, Information from: The Detroit News, \n",

            "Message: Exclusive - Why We March for Life: ‘To Show That Millennials Care’  Tens of thousands of young people are marching for life in Washington, D. C.[In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, some students from The Catholic University of America (CUA) in the nation’s capital say they are marching to show millennials care about women in crisis pregnancies and their babies.  CUA student Christiana Gellert says it’s important Americans know millennials care about something more than what’s superficial. “I’m here to show that millennials care about something more than just changing our profile pictures or putting up an angry status on Facebook, to show we’re willing to brave the cold weather and the blizzard for what’s important,” she explains. Fellow student Isaac Kimmel asserts, “March for Life gives us an opportunity to win this for the cause of life. ” “It’s pretty hard to ignore 300, 000 people walking down the streets of DC and across the national mall,” he continues. “This is a cause that’s very frequently ignored by the national media, and it’s a difficult cause because it’s often very contentious. It’s important to keep it in the national consciousness. ” Kimmel says Americans need to be reminded that abortion has been legal in this country for over four decades. “Abortion has cost our country tens of millions of lives,” he says. “And so we’re here to remind people of how intolerable the situation is. ” CUA student Mary Castellano tells Breitbart News she is marching to give children and mothers in crisis pregnancies a voice. “Every single life is precious, every life is sacred no matter how they were conceived, no matter the circumstances of their mother’s life,” she continues. “They need to be given a voice  —   that’s why we’re all here today  —   to speak up for those who can’t speak up for themselves. ” Castellano  —   a sidewalk counselor at abortion clinics  —   says she knows very well first hand that people going into an abortion clinic often feel they have no choice. “We want to be here to offer people a choice of adoption, a choice of something more than just termination of a life,” she asserts. “People go in thinking there’s no other choice, so we are absolutely      —   110%. ”\n",

            "Message: ‘We had to pull nails out of children’s faces’: Homeless men helped after Manchester blast      Chris Parker came to Manchester Arena as an anonymous beggar, positioning himself near the crowd of exiting Ariana Grande fans in hopes that he might pocket some spare change. He left the arena distraught after having witnessed the kind of carnage more typically seen in fields of combat. Sometime in between, the    homeless man became a hero, a symbol of hope in a stunned nation craving exactly that. In turn, Parker and another homeless rescuer are being rewarded for their daring actions, though the devastation they encountered left them scarred. Parker told the Press Association that life changed the moment he “heard a bang,” then “a white flash” followed by smoke and the sound of screaming. “It knocked me to the floor and then I got up and instead of running away my gut instinct was to run back and try and help,” he told the wire service. “There was people lying on the floor everywhere. “I saw a little girl   …     she had no legs,” he added. “I wrapped her in one of the merchandise   and I said, ’Where is your mum and daddy? ’” He is haunted by what he encountered, he said. “There were nuts and bolts all over the floor,” Parker told the Press Association. “People had holes in their back. ” “It’s the screams I can’t get over, and the smell.   …     I don’t like to say it, but it smelled like burning flesh. ” There was also a wounded woman  —   “in her 60s,” he guessed  —   whom Parker tried to comfort. “She passed away in my arms,” he said. “I haven’t stopped crying. ”   [‘So young and sweet’: Friends remember Manchester victim who loved Ariana Grande]   Police believe the violence was carried out by Salman Abedi, a young,   suicide bomber. Authorities say 22 people  —   including an    girl  —   were killed by the blast, and another 59 were injured, many gravely. The Islamic State claimed that one of its “soldiers” carried out the attack, without providing details about the suspect or how it was accomplished. British investigators continue to search for links to potential accomplices as they try to determine responsibility.       Here’s what you need to know about Salman Abedi, the    attacker who killed 22 at a concert in Manchester, England. (Sarah   Washington Post)   British Prime Minister Theresa May called it a “callous terrorist attack” that “stands out for its appalling, sickening cowardice deliberately targeting innocent, defenseless children and young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives. ” Parker was not the only homeless man who rushed to the aid of concertgoers, according to reports. He was joined by Stephen Jones, who had been sleeping outside the arena before rushing inside to help, according to the Press Association. Jones told ITV News that he initially thought the loud bang was a firework. But he noticed women and children stumbling out of the venue screaming, their bodies covered in blood. “There was a lot of homeless people that stayed there and helped, and that’s what we done,” said Jones, a former bricklayer who has been homeless for about a year. “And obviously when we seen children like that with blood   …     having to pull nails and stuff out of their arms and I pulled one out of this little girl’s face. ” “If I didn’t help I wouldn’t be able to live with myself walking away and leaving kids like that,” he said. Since the harrowing accounts went viral, the public has rallied, raising money for both men online. A GoFundMe page that originally aimed to raise £1, 000 ($1, 300) for Parker rocketed beyond its original goal, with nearly £35, 000 donated in a single day. “Thank you for helping those in need,” Jessica Summerfield, who donated £50, wrote on the page. “Now it’s our turn to help you. ” The crowdfunding campaign also elicited a response from a woman claiming to be Parker’s mother, who said she had lost touch with her adult son. “This is my son and I am desperate to get in touch with him,” Jessica Parker wrote. “We have been estranged for a very long time, and I had no idea he was homeless. I am very proud of him, and I think he might need me right now. ” A JustGiving page set up to raise £25, 000 for Stephen Jones has raised nearly that much. “This started out as a way to get Steve somewhere to stay,” wrote Diane Moore, who launched the crowdfunding campaign. “Now, I think we can upgrade it to somewhere permanent to live!” Jones told ITV News that his housing situation had no bearing on his actions. “Just because I’m homeless, it doesn’t mean I haven’t got a heart,” he said. “There’s a lot of good people with Manchester who help us out and we need to give back too. ”   ’We had to pull nails out of children’s faces’: Steve, a homeless man who was sleeping near #Manchester Arena, rushed to help young victims pic. twitter.   —   ITV News (@itvnews) May 23, 2017   MORE READING:  Pope Francis presents Trump with a ‘politically loaded gift’: His encyclical on climate change Britain dispatches military as it stares down the threat of further attacks Manchester shows why even the best protection can’t stop attacks\n",

            "Message:  Mexican Government Complicit In Disappearance Of 43 Students, Report Finds  The   report commissioned by the   Commission on Human Rights was released Sunday and is the latest chapter in a saga that unfolded on Sept. 26, 2014. The students from a rural college in Ayotzinapa in Guerrero State were on their way to Mexico City aboard buses they commandeered to participate in a demonstration marking the events of Oct. 2, 1968, when soldiers and police killed killed dozens of demonstrators. Early on in the investigation, the students’ families rejected the official account of what happened that day, believing the Mexican government played a direct role. The missing students have never been found. Mexican authorities said the students were kidnapped and likely killed by members of a drug cartel after being corralled by local police on the order of Jose Luis Abarca, mayor of Iguala, Guerrero. Abarca allegedly had the students rounded up to prevent them from protesting a speech by his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda. But researchers pushed back on that account, saying local, state, and federal authorities had been monitoring the students on the day they were attacked, hours before they arrived in Iguala. By the time they arrived, it was nearly an hour after Pineda’s event had ended, making it unlikely that they’d be attacked for trying to protest the speech. One of the men accused of attacking the students, Patricio “El Pato” Reyes Landa, said he was given electric shocks on the inside of his mouth and testicles, waterboarded, and beaten into confessing to the attacks by Mexican police. “They threatened they would make me into pieces and throw me inside a bag,” Landa said. The report also accused the federal government of destroying a video tape from federal security cameras that captured the attack on the bus that the students were on.  The experts also said that when they asked to inspect one of the five buses involved in the attack, it was replaced with another   one. The international team said the Mexican government was also slow to respond to their requests, delayed test results, and refused to open other lines of investigation. “These can’t be read as simple improvised obstacles,” the report states. “These different situations show barriers that aren’t occasional, but structural in the investigation. ”  \n",

            "Message: West Virginia police officer sues after being fired for not shooting black man In the aftermath of the May 2016 police shooting that left    RJ Williams dead in Weirton, West Virginia, police officer Stephen Mader was shocked, nervous and scared. “I was at a loss for what to do,” he told the Guardian. Mader’s reaction was not to the shooting itself, which he feels he handled with poise and calm. In fact, he did not fire his weapon. It was a fellow officer’s gun that ended Williams’ life. Mader was dumbstruck to have been handed a notice of termination, which indicated that his failure to shoot Williams, a young black father who was mentally ill, represented grounds for dismissal. “It was just a right hook out of nowhere, right to the face,” said Mader, who grew up in the small town of Weirton before becoming an officer there. “Essentially they fired [Mader] for respecting RJ Williams’ constitutional rights,” said Joseph Cohen of the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia. The notice of termination accused Mader of “negligence”. “[Patrolman] Mader’s failure to react left himself and those around him in grave danger,” it read. On Wednesday, Mader filed a lawsuit against the city for wrongful termination. “When a police [officer] exercises restraint  —   and sometimes we don’t see that as much as we like to  —   that’s something that should be praised rather than punished,” said Mader’s attorney, Tim O’Brien. The suit alleges that the city, “in a flawed effort to buttress the other officer’s use of deadly force, wrongfully terminated Mr Mader’s employment. When that termination came to light in the local press, the city then engaged in a pattern of retaliation designed to destroy Mr Mader’s reputation. ” As police responded to a disturbance at Williams’ home early on the morning of 6 May 2016, Mader was the first officer on the scene. When he arrived and confronted Williams, he said, the man was keeping his hands behind his back. Mader commanded Williams to show his hands and when they came down to his sides Mader saw he was holding a pistol. Mader drew his weapon. Williams allegedly screamed: “Just shoot me!” “I said, ‘I don’t wanna shoot you, brother, just put down the gun,’” Mader recalled. “About that time two more cruisers arrived. At this point he starts to wave his gun at me and the other officers, and within seconds of the other officers getting out of their cruisers there were four shots fired. ” Williams’ gun, investigators would later learn, was not loaded. In the termination letter, Mader’s superiors argued that he failed to respond to the threat. “The unfortunate reality of police work is that making any decision is better than making no decision at all,” it says. Mader counters that he did make a decision  —   that he decided, based on Williams’ body language and apparent mental state, that he did not present a threat and that   was the best way to proceed. Mader had a degree of familiarity with    situations. A former US marine who saw service in Afghanistan, he said he brought some of that mettle to his job as an officer. “He wasn’t angry,” he said of Williams, “he wasn’t aggressive, he didn’t seem in position to want to use a gun against anybody. He never pointed it at me. I didn’t perceive him as an imminent threat. ” Mader’s commanding officers essentially argued that such an evaluation was not his to make. “No officer was ever trained to deduce the intention of a suspect,” the termination notice reads. O’Brien disagrees. “If the emphasis is, ‘You must use deadly force if you can use deadly force’,” he said, “then you are taking away that critical discretion that every police officer must have. ” Despite the fact that the termination letter focuses most of its attention on the decision not to shoot Williams, department officials subsequently told the Pittsburgh   the incident was “not a primary factor in his termination”. Officials cited two other incidents involving Mader. Only one is mentioned in the letter, in just two sentences. By contrast, on the Williams shooting the letter reads that Mader “should be dismissed from employment   …     due to to negligence on his part during the incident that occurred on 6 May 2016, in which a fellow officer had to react and unfortunately take the life of the suspect”. After Mader’s termination, officials said Mader “froze” during the incident. They also called him a “disgruntled employee” and a “bad cop”. According to the suit, Mader is seeking damages in excess of $75, 000. The city of Weirton and the Weirton police department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

            "Message: People who took a gamble on Trump’s nomination walked away rich.      Last week, Donald Trump “humbly and gratefully” accepted the Republican nomination for president, putting an end to perhaps the most unpredictable primary season in recent history. And yet, this whole time, people still tried to predict it. Last summer at Trump’s announcement and through the fall and winter, journalists called his victory “an extreme long shot,” saying he was “not a real candidate” and had “no serious chance of winning”. And people outside the news media seemed to agree. Betting markets run by companies like PredictIt and Betfair allow ordinary Americans to place bets on whether a certain event will occur. The more of a   people think the outcome is, the greater the profit would be upon its occurrence. [A visual history of Donald Trump dominating the news cycle] Betting markets, then, can be used to trace the expected probability of an event over time. In the case of Donald Trump’s nomination, it started as a serious long shot, with more than 10:1 odds, which declined over the next nine months as it became increasingly clear that Trump would be the nominee. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, had the nomination on lock this whole time, in the eyes of the market. In the graphic below, you can see how the profit made off of a bet for Trump and Clinton’s nomination changed over time.    These trend lines provide a look back at the events of the primary season and a glimpse into the psyches of the American people watching the unprecedented campaign unfold. Trump’s odds of victory started out extremely volatile, falling by a third one day and doubling over the next two, as the Trump campaign’s initial provocations  —   calling Mexicans “rapists, hiring actors to attend the announcement, fighting with Univision over holding the Miss USA pageant  —   were outside the political norm. Similar volatility occurred following his first debate appearance and subsequent conflict with moderator Megyn Kelly. But over time, it seems the markets started to habituate to Trump’s unique style, showing almost no reaction after Trump proposed a ban on Muslim immigration in December. At times, the movements in the markets seemed to be logical and predictable. There was a noticeable dip as Trump’s polling surge continued through the summer, and after Jeb Bush, originally an establishment favorite, left the race. Trump said it himself when he accepted the nomination: “Who would have believed that when we started this journey” that he would receive a   number of votes. Well, someone did. And now, they’re rolling in it.\n",

            "Message: RABBI SHMULEY: Spicer’s Actions Redeem His Words on Assad  I have no doubt that President Barack Obama was   when, rather than enforcing his “red line” in August of 2013 after Syrian dictator Bashar   gassed to death more than 1000 innocent Arabs, he chose not to attack Assad but to forge an ultimately fraudulent deal to remove Assad’s chemical weapons instead. [But intentions don’t count when it comes to mass murder. You either take action or you don’t. And President Obama chose not to. Obama’s inaction will forever stain his legacy.  I have noted elsewhere that April 7, the day in Syria when Trump launched his retaliatory attack, was the commemoration of the Rwandan genocide. More than 800, 000 people were hacked to death in three months in 1994. The world watched in silence as the Tutsis were dismembered. President Bill Clinton did not lift a finger to help them, and in 1998 he traveled to Rwanda to apologize. His words, as usual, were eloquent. But surely the people of Rwanda would have preferred mistaken comments by Clinton’s press secretary matched by action to stop the slaughter, rather than an eloquent apology that was too little, too late. Trump and his people may not have found all the right words in defending their attack on Assad. Press Secretary Sean Spicer certainly did not. But when it comes to combatting genocide, words are trivial and action is everything. I am grateful to Sean Spicer and the members of the Trump team for taking action to give value to innocent Arab life. For the past two days, I was in a news blackout due to the Passover holiday. The festival ended, and I saw that my inbox was filled with media asking me to comment on Spicer’s remarks about Hitler, poison gas, and the Holocaust. As a rabbi, I cannot broadcast on any Jewish holy day. But I felt Spicer deserved defending after his apology, so here goes. Hitler was the most evil man that ever lived. He gassed, shot, and burned six million Jews and started wars that led so the deaths of approximately 100 million people. He was a monster the likes of which the world has never seen. No one should be compared to Hitler. But it is also true that Hitler is the godfather of all modern genocide, and all those who attempt the extermination of an ethnic group are Hitler’s ideological stepchildren. True, genocide did not start with Hitler, but with the Ottoman Turks and their mass murder of the Armenians during World War I  —   a genocide that the amoral world still barely recognizes. But Hitler has become mass murder’s symbol, and was responsible for the most   and   genocide of all time. Spicer is right to point out Assad’s relationship with Hitler, since the Syrian butcher is attempting a genocide of Sunni Muslims in Syria carried out by Alawite militias, Shia Iran, and Hezbollah (which is also Shia). All of that has been aided and abetted by Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Spicer is also correct to point out that the use of nerve agents against one’s own people is a unique form of evil from which Assad can now never escape. Assad should be removed because no man who gasses his people must ever be allowed to stay in power. Where Spicer was absolutely wrong was when he said that Hitler had not used chemical gas against his own people, given that Hitler murdered something in the region of 200, 000 German Jews during the Holocaust  —   not to mention the millions of others who were gassed at Birkenau, Belzec, Treblinka,   and so many other camps. I understand what Spicer was trying to say  —   namely, that there were areas where Assad was even worse than Hitler, insofar as the Damascus butcher used chemical gas on the battlefield, something, interestingly, which Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany used in World War I but the Wehrmacht seemed not to have used in battlefield conditions in the Second World War. Yet Spicer was wrong because all of Europe was a battlefield during that war, and the gas chambers where 1. 5 million Jewish children met their end was history’s most horrible use ever of chemical agents in war. But Spicer apologized  —   and, it seems, he did so sincerely, much regretting his mistake. He deserves to be forgiven and we should move on. Those who wrote blogs calling Spicer an antisemite are guilty of character assassination and debasing the term. The Jews have real enemies in the world. Sean Spicer has used his pulpit at the White House repeatedly to defend the Jewish State and condemn genocidal Iran. He should be considered a friend of the Jewish people. What is far more important to me, as a member of a people who experienced genocide, is that the Trump administration decided to reverse course from previous American inaction at the gassing of Syrian children, and strike hard at the Assad regime, showing them that Never Again must mean just that, Never Again. For nearly four years we watched as America became a toothless tiger in relation to Syria, forever huffing and puffing but never striking at Assad for the use of nerve agents against kids. Surely even the biggest Trump haters must applaud the president for his honorable action at striking back at the beast. The crime of the Holocaust is unique in world history. It brooks no comparisons. But genocides of any stripe are humanity’s highest abomination, and poison gas is poison gas. America had a moral responsibility to hit the Assad regime for dropping sarin gas on children. And nothing that can be said about that action will ever be as important as the action itself. To see Syrian jets smoldering in ruins at the hands of the American military is to take just pride in being citizens of the most righteous nation on earth. Many of the memoirs of Auschwitz survivors relate how the prisoners prayed daily that they might see American bombers punishing the SS for operating the gas chambers at Birkenau. They prayed even though they knew that such bombing runs would cost them their own lives. But the bombers never came, thereby forever staining the legacies of even truly great men like Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, who ultimately defeated Hitler. It’s time to applaud and thank President Trump and his administration, Spicer included, for taking decisive action in Syria to save Arab life. Because only action, and not words, are that which will ensure that Never Again means Never Again.

            "Message: Trapped in North Korea: What can Malaysia do to get its citizens back?  (CNN) Four Malaysian diplomats and their family members are stuck in North Korea, and there’s not much their government can do to get them out. All nine of them are pawns in the diplomatic fight that’s followed the murder of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s   who was killed in a Malaysian airport in February.  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak accused Pyongyang of holding Malaysia’s citizens ”hostage” and retaliated by issuing a similar ban for North Koreans in Malaysia. Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told reporters Tuesday discussions were underway with Pyongyang for the safe return of their citizens. But is there anything else that can be done? ”Right now there are no good options,” said Ming Wan, a professor of government and politics at George Mason University in Virginia. ”They (the Malaysians) are stuck.” Whatever path he chooses, Malaysia’s Prime Minister finds himself in a situation no other Malaysian leader has ever faced. ”There has never been a case of Malaysian diplomats being trapped in a    with another country,” said Yang Razali, a Malaysian politics expert at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.  Fortunately for Najib, the trapped Malaysians appear to be safe. They are free to carry on with their lives, Najib said Wednesday.  But they’re not free to leave. Here are three options the Malaysians might consider, going from least plausible to most likely. Option 1: ’Argo’ it  With foreign diplomats trapped in a hostile country, the situation has some parallels to the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979. But an operation like the one depicted in the movie ”Argo” likely wouldn’t work, says CNN national security analyst Steve Hall. The film tells the   story of a CIA agent who staged a fake movie to smuggle Americans out of Iran. The Malaysians would have to try to sneak inside what is essentially a police state that’s closed off to the rest of the world. ”Now that it’s become so public and everybody knows what’s going on, I really think the clandestine, covert way to smuggle people out    and especially that many on both sides    I don’t know that it’s doable,” said Hall, a former CIA chief of Russia operations.  ”I don’t know that any intelligence professional could actually recommend it as a reasonable way to go forward.” The North Koreans probably have a better shot at getting their folks, Hall says    they’re much less predictable than the Malaysians. With Pyongyang, ”you can’t really rule anything out,” said Hall. ”It’s just so unpredictable, it’s hard to know what the North Koreans are going to do.”  Option 2: Give in, Malaysia could accede Pyongyang’s demand by publicly guaranteeing the safety of North Koreans in Malaysia and hope North Korea allows its citizens to leave. But that’s not likely.  Pyongyang barred the Malaysians in North Korea from leaving unless Kuala Lumpur fully guaranteed through the fair settlement of the case involving Kim’s death. ”We have not taken any negative action against North Korea. What we are facing now is the result of their action in assassinating their own citizen in Malaysia, on Malaysian soil, using a strictly banned chemical weapon,” Najib said Wednesday, the first time Malaysia had publicly blamed North Korea for killing Kim Jong Nam, an allegation Pyongyang denies. That doesn’t sound like a man willing to give up. But there may be domestic politics at play here. With a general election looming in Malaysia    the Prime Minister must call one before August 2018    Najib can’t afford to look weak, Razali told CNN in an email.  He already has two Malaysians on their way back. The pair, who worked for the United Nations’ World Food Programme, were able to leave Pyongyang Thursday, according to a WFP spokeswoman.  It’s not known how many North Koreans are in Malaysia.  Option 3: Compromise, The two countries could reach an agreement.  Despite the depiction of North Korea as a ”hermit Kingdom,” it does have relationships in Asia. ”We like to imagine North Korea in the West as a hermetically sealed country, but throughout Asia they have far more flexibility and freedom of operation than you’d like to imagine,” says Alexander Neill, a senior fellow for Asia Pacific security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Najib says he’s willing to negotiate. Malaysia will not sever diplomatic ties with North Korea to keep a line of communication open, he said.  But Malaysian officials are not sure what exactly North Korea is now demanding, according to Najib. Early in the investigation, Pyongyang demanded Kim’s body back. It’s still in Malaysian custody, and police said they won’t release it until someone provides a DNA sample. By keeping the Malaysians from leaving, North Korea has strengthened its hand.  While there are also North Koreans being barred from leaving Malaysia, Neill says Pyongyang does not have the same approach to human rights as most of the rest of the world does. ”They are known to have an entirely different approach to the sanctity of human life and human rights due to the nature of the regime. And it is a brutal regime,” Neill told CNN. North Korea is accused of carrying out hundreds of extrajudicial killings, operating gulags that house more than 100, 000 people and abducting people across Asia.  But there are a few people North Korea cares about. Three of its nationals are believed to be holed up in the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. They’re wanted for questioning in connection with Kim’s murder, and may have access to sensitive or compromising information that Pyongyang doesn’t want to get out. Releasing them might secure the release of Malaysia’s own citizens, but police have made it clear that they’re not going to let the North Koreans within the embassy leave easily. International pressure is an option, but a difficult one. The litany of sanctions levied against North Korea to curtail its nuclear program don’t appear to be working.  ”This is yet another indication that the North Korean government is acting in a way that should be a concern for the international community,” said Wan, the professor at George Mason University. China, Pyongyang’s most important partner, could help push the country to negotiate. But Beijing doesn’t wield as much influence over Kim Jong Un as it did over his father and grandfather, experts said. ”I don’t see anybody being able to pressure them,” said Wan. ”I think we’re going to have to watch this for a while.” \n",

            "Message: The Democratic party is undermining Bernie Sanders-style candidates Since losing the presidency to a   reality TV host, the Democratic party’s leadership has made it clear that it would rather keep losing than entertain even the slightest whiff of New Deal style social democracy. The Bernie Sanders wing might bring grassroots energy and  —   if the polls are to be believed  —   popular ideas, but their redistributive policies pose too much of a threat to the party’s big donors to ever be allowed on the agenda.  Even a symbolic victory cedes too much to those youthful, unwashed hordes who believe healthcare and education are human rights and not extravagant luxuries, as we saw when the Democratic establishment recruited Tom Perez to defeat the   progressive Keith Ellison for DNC chair. The Democrats demonstrated this once more this week when, in a special election triggered by Trump’s tapping of Mike Pompeo for CIA director, a Berniecrat named James Thompson came painfully close to winning a Kansas Congressional seat that had been red for over two decades, and his party didn’t even try to help him. If Thompson’s picture is not on the Wikipedia page for “  populism,” it really should be. Following a difficult upbringing during which he was homeless for a time, he joined the Army and attended college on the GI bill. He went on to graduate from Wichita State University and Washburn University before going into practice as a civil rights lawyer. He owns guns and looks natural in a trucker hat. In a Reddit AMA, Thompson said he was “inspired to run by Bernie” and talked about “progressive values” like universal healthcare, education, and a $  minimum wage. He also spoke in favor of taxing and legalizing marijuana, regulating Wall Street and overturning Citizens United. It’s no surprise he received the endorsement of Our Revolution, the progressive political action organization spun out of Sanders’ candidacy. After beating an establishment Democrat in the primary, Thompson promised to take on Trump and the Republicans, as well as the state’s unpopular Republican governor Sam Brownback and   oligarchs the Koch brothers.  In one campaign ad, Thompson shoots an   rifle at a target before delivering a broad,   appeal: “People of all colors, all races, all religions, they want the basic same thing   …     they want to be able to provide for their family, provide a good education for their kids. We’ve got to get back to this country being about the working class family. ”  While his candidacy initially seemed like a long shot in a district that had   Pompeo just last year with 60. 7% of the vote, in the weeks before the election, the race grew unexpectedly close.  This led to a sudden infusion of cash from the National Republican Congressional Committee to Thompson’s opponent Ron Estes, who in the end raised $459, 000, $130, 000 of it from the NRCC. He also received massive donations from representatives of big business and help from such national figures as Paul Ryan, Mike Pence, Ted Cruz, and the president himself, who tweeted about the race.  Estes spent much of his money on TV attack ads, like the one that claimed Thompson supports using tax dollars to fund late term abortions, as well as abortions performed because parents don’t like the gender of their baby. Given our current political climate, you’d think the Democrats would have jumped at the chance to take back a Congressional seat and demonstrate opposition to Trump, but you’d be wrong. While Thompson managed to raise $292, 000 without his party’s help, 95% of which came from individuals, neither the DNC, DCCC, nor even the Kansas Democratic Party would help him grow that total in any substantial way. His campaign requested $20, 000 from the state Democratic Party and was denied.  They later relented and gave him $3, 000. (According to the FEC, the Party had about $145, 000 on hand.) The national Democratic Party gave him nothing until the day before the election, when it graced him with some live calls and  . He lost by seven percentage points. In an interview with The Washington Post, Perez confirmed the DNC would not be giving Thompson a dime. “We can make progress in Kansas,” he said. “There are thousands of elections every year, though. Can we invest in all of them? That would require a major increase in funds. ” Fact check: the DNC has a fund just for Congressional elections, of which there are just ten this year. Contrast this with what Perez said just a few months earlier when he promised “a   strategy” complete with “rural outreach and organizers in every zip code. ” In a   interview with NPR, he specifically name checked Kansas as a place Democrats could win. Why the sudden about face? In defending their decision, party mouthpieces have taken the absurd line that giving Thompson money would have actually hurt his chances of winning, because then everyone would have known he’s a Democrat, and Kansans hate Democrats. (Let’s take a moment to appreciate these are the same people who keep saying the party doesn’t need a new direction.)  “You do not get to the single digits in a district like this if you’re a nationalized Democrat,” DCCC communications director Meredith Kelly told The Huffington Post. “End of story. That’s just the way it is. There are just certain races where it is not helpful to be attached to the national D. C. Democrats. ” End of story, idiot. Nobody must have told Kelly that Thompson was already attached to the “national DC Democrats” by virtue of being in their party, a fact Estes was happy to exploit in an attack ad that showed him waist deep in a literal swamp he hoped to drain.  “The liberals are trying to steal this election by supporting a Bernie Sanders backed lawyer, because they know he will vote how Nancy Pelosi tells him to,” he claimed. Seems Thompson got all the bad parts of being a Democrat this time around, and none of the good ones. One person the party does not think will be hurt by their help is Jon Ossoff, who is running in a similarly red, but much wealthier, district in Georgia. To date, the DNC has raised some $8. 3m for him and has committed to sending nine field staffers to organize    efforts.  Although he is young, he’s an acolyte of the Democratic establishment, having worked for Representatives John Lewis and Hank Johnson, and he endorsed Hillary Clinton in the primary. He went to Georgetown followed by the London School of Economics and speaks fluent French. He has the support of several Hollywood celebrities.  Democrats think Ossoff is just the guy to bring his affluent suburban district back into the fold. (Clearly, losing a national election was not enough to reverse course on that most doomed of 2016 strategies: trading blue collar whites for wealthy, suburban ones.)  Georgia Democratic Party spokesman Michael Smith said this is the state organization’s chance to “deliver the White House its first electoral defeat. ” Liberal bloggers are wetting their pants over this “weather vane” of early Trump backlash. It’s like Thompson’s campaign never even happened. By refusing to fund the campaigns of anyone but centrist, establishment shills, the Democratic Party aims to make the Berniecrats’ lack of political viability a   prophecy: starve their campaigns of resources so they can’t win, then point to said losses as examples of why they can’t win.  If that means a few more red seats in Congress, so be it. The more they do this, though, the less of Bernie’s “political revolution” will be absorbed by the Democratic Party and the more will go shooting off into third parties and direct action.  Feel free to keep eating your own, Democrats. At this rate, we’ll have a socialist party in no time. \n",

            "Message: Watch: CNN’s Cuomo Battles Trump Supporter Michael Cohen Over Bill Clinton and ’Enabler-in-Chief’ Hillary Clinton  Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day,” presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump surrogate and attorney Michael Cohen had a   battle with host Chris Cuomo over Trump’s attacks on former President Bill Clinton and his Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential   for their past treatment of women.  Defending Trump, Cohen said,”What he is doing is he is exposing, not just Bill Clinton for what he was and what he had done, but it’ the same as it relates to Hillary. She attacked Mr. Trump as being a sexist, misogynist, and that is inaccurate Donald Trump is not any of those things. They’re trying to portray him as such so they can turn the women against Mr. Trump, when in fact, the women seem to be turning against Hillary Clinton for being the   . ” He continued, “What she is doing is defecting. She is the enabler in chief and he happens to be the sexist. So instead, she needs to win the women’s vote. That’s what she needs. She is not going to win the men’s vote. She needs to go after the women’s vote. She is not going to be able to do that if Donald Trump is not portrayed by the Clinton campaign as a sexist. So she is deflecting. ” On Trump’s past defense of Bill Clinton’s indiscretions, Cuomo asked, “Here are my two reason I think it’s bad for him, one hypocrite, two glass houses. He defended Bill Clinton for years. He said the same allegations that you guys are talking about now were a waste of time, were wrong, were hollow, that Bill Clinton was a terrific guy. That he was a great president, that the impeachment was wrong, that it was a waste of time. ” Cohen interjected, “And Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump was on of the smartest best businessman in the Untied States. All he is doing is giving the facts. He was a private citizen who was friendly with the Clintons and he was trying to protect a friend. Now, it’s a different game. It’s 2016, he is the Republican presidential nominee. ” Cuomo asked,  “So he was lying then?” Cohen said, “He was not lying, he was protecting a friend. There’s a difference. Cuomo pressed, “What is the difference?” Cohen added, “The difference is he was being a true friend. It didn’t matter to him. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n",

            "Message: What Fiorina Brings to Cruz’s Ticket Our Tim Alberta reports that Ted Cruz will name Carly Fiorina his running mate for the presidency this afternoon. How does she help Cruz, who is currently sputtering in second place and running out of chances to beat Donald Trump? She’s strong and polished on the stump, equally at home giving a big policy speech, answering questions at a town hall, or offering   on a   talk show. She’s an outsider, in a year when political neophytes are all the rage. And most important of all, she has the best chance of any potential running mate to negate presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s political strengths. Fiorina can rip into Clinton without fear of being called sexist. She can also coopt Clinton’s message to female voters, letting them know that she’s been through exactly the same aggravations and indignities they’ve experienced in their everyday lives. She made a point of claiming the feminist mantle away from Democrats even as she announced that she was suspending her campaign: Do not let others define you. Do not listen to anyone who says you have to vote a certain way or for a certain candidate because you’re a woman. That is not feminism. Feminism doesn’t shut down conversations or threaten women. It is not about ideology. It is not a weapon to wield against your political opponent. A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses and uses all her   gifts. Share article on FacebookshareTweet But there are also reasons for the Cruz campaign to temper its optimism. As impressive as candidate Fiorina was to many Republicans, her campaign flamed out quite quickly. And while not many pollsters asked voters about her this year, the ones who did found her favorability rating in the 20s  —   it peaked at 30  —   and her unfavorability in the high 30s to  . There are, in short, other, more popular Republicans, including women, whom Cruz could have chosen, and there isn’t much evidence Fiorina would help him in any key   swing states. Will Fiorina help Cruz in the California presidential primary? Though she’s a known commodity statewide, having lost the 2010 Senate race to Barbara Boxer, there’s little evidence that California Republicans see her as a favorite daughter. At one point, in October, she rose to 13 percent in polling of likely Republican voters there. But by January, she was back down to 3 percent. More Ted Cruz You gotta have heart, c. Ted Cruz in a Surprising New Role: Mediator, on   ReformThe shocking speed of entrenchment, c. If nothing else, the   ticket will sharpen the contrast for Republicans from here on out. Nearly 40 percent of the party’s voters are behind Trump, content to ignore the ominous polling, the reports of infighting at the top levels of his campaign, and the contradictory policy proposals that come out of his mouth. By picking Fiorina, Cruz is practically shouting that he and his new running mate can deliver victory and mitigate the gender gap in November, while Trump cannot. We’ll know soon whether enough voters heed his cries.,\n",

            "Message: Donald Trump’s Astounding Victory: How and Why Astounding. That’s the best word to describe the tumultuous election night and the (to most people) surprise victory of Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton hoped to win with votes of Northeasterners, including those who have moved south along Interstate 95 to North Carolina and Florida (44 electoral votes). Instead, Trump won with votes along the   and   corridors, from Pennsylvania through Ohio and Michigan to Wisconsin and Iowa (70 electoral votes). This approach was foreseen by RealClearPolitics analyst Sean Trende in his “Case of the Missing White Voters” article series in 2013.    whites in this northern tier, once strong for Ross Perot, gave Barack Obama relatively high percentages in 2008 and 2012. Many grew up in Democratic union households and were willing to vote for the first black president. It didn’t help that Clinton called half of Trump supporters “irredeemable” and “deplorables” and infected with “implicit racism. ” They may have been shy in responding to telephone or exit polls, but they voted in unanticipatedly large numbers, at a time when turnout generally sagged. At the same time, Clinton was unable to reassemble Obama’s 2012 51 percent coalition. Turnout fell in heavily black Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee. Millennial generation turnout was tepid, and Trump carried white Millennials by 5 points. Unexpectedly, Trump won higher percentages of Hispanics and Asians than Mitt Romney did in 2012. Trump’s surprise victory, owing much to differential turnout, resembles the surprise defeats, defying most polls, of establishment positions in 2016 referendums in Britain and Colombia. In June, 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the European Union  —   the   Brexit, opposed by most   leaders and financial elites. In October, 50. 2 percent of Colombia’s voters rejected the peace plan with FARC terrorists negotiated by their president. In both cases, the capital city’s metro area and distinctive peripheries  —   Scotland, the Caribbean coast  —   voted with the establishment. But the historical and cultural hearts of these nations  —   England outside London, the central Andes cordillera in Colombia  —   rejected and defeated the establishment position. Something like that seems to have happened here. If you take the   coasts  —   the Northeast except Pennsylvania, the West Coast  —   the vote as currently tabulated was   percent for Clinton. That’s similar to Obama’s   percent margin in these states in 2012. RELATED:   Trump Did Not Create the Movement, It Created Him, But the heartland  —   roughly the area from the Appalachian ridges to the Rocky Mountains, with about   of the national vote  —   went   percent for Trump. Trump didn’t do much better than Romney, who got 51 percent there. But Clinton got only 44 percent of heartland votes, down from Obama’s 47 percent. The Republican margin doubled, from 4 to 8 percent. British elites responded to Brexit with scorn for their heartland’s voters. Those voting for Brexit were “poorly educated, nativist, unsophisticated, racist, and unfashionable. ” You can hear similar invective hurled by American coastal elites (though not, to their credit, Clinton and Obama) at their fellow citizens beyond the Hudson River and the Capital Beltway. “Deplorable” is the least of their insults. They take glee in noting that Trump ran behind previous Republican nominees among college graduates but well ahead among    whites. There’s an echo here of Rush Limbaugh’s scorn for “  voters. ” But the people who complain about less educated whites voting as a bloc have no complaints about the even larger percentages received by the candidates they favor from black voters. The better approach is to show respect for each voter’s decision, however unenlightened you may consider it. More Donald Trump Trump’s Morning Joe TweetsA Question Needing an AnswerIs Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? Trump’s victory undercuts crude projections based on the sophisticated analysis of journalist Ron Brownstein and Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg  —   namely, that increasing percentages of nonwhites and millennial generation voters will result in an “ascendant” majority producing inevitably Democratic victories. In a closely divided country, election victories are contingent on issues, events, and candidates’ characteristics. It would be a mistake also to suppose that Trump’s Electoral College victory means that Democrats are doomed to defeat because they lost their hold on    whites this year. That depends on decisions and events that have not yet occurred.,\n",

            "Message: At CPAC, conservatism betrayed  Remember when conservatism meant deep thinkers and big ideas? Get over it.

Presumably, this is considered cool to a certain demographic, though Loesch, at 38, might be considered  . Her message, if I may dare an interpretation: It’s safe for the cool and hip to attend a convention dominated by gnarly    —   although, fair warning, President Trump is also planning to attend.  In another sign of conservative disruption, the speaker lineup is missing many of conservatism’s most interesting voices. Sometimes getting a turn at the lectern depends on one’s willingness to contribute to CPAC’s parent organization, the American Conservative Union. Oftentimes, sponsors want to speak   direct the agenda. Which doesn’t sound quite like free speech. Also necessary is one’s ringing support of Trump. Those who entertain subversive thinking, also known as thinking  aren’t invited. Finally, the straw that broke the elephant’s back was intended speaker Milo Yiannopoulos, or just Milo for ease of spelling. For the uninitiated, Milo is a provocateur infamous for saying anything. He makes Trump seem like a paragon of restraint by comparison. Think of him as a British hybrid of Howard Stern and Ann Coulter. His penchant for the outrageous backfired on him when a video from last year surfaced in which Milo praised sex between    boys and adult men as “ ” in the gay community. Ruminating on his own sexual prowess, he boasted that he wouldn’t be nearly as good were it not for his own alleged childhood molestation at the hands of a Catholic priest. Milo denies that this constitutes pedophilia or pederasty.  Did CPAC officialdom not know whom they were inviting? Milo’s record is hardly obscure. He, too, was a Breitbart fellow. Are you noting a trend here? On Monday, Milo’s CPAC invitation was rescinded following loud protests. Then on Tuesday, Milo resigned as tech editor for Breitbart News.  His utterly bizarre selection fairly yawns with Republican irony. Recall that in 2015, the gay Log Cabin Republicans weren’t allowed to participate in CPAC. Apparently eager to show that conservatives aren’t   the organization this year invited an   who happens to be gay. Matt Schlapp, CPAC organizer and ACU chair (as well as lobbyist and political commentator) defended the invitation, saying Milo could talk about his recent experience at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was canceled as a speaker following student protests.  It seems no one outside of a comedy club wants to hear what Milo has to say. Yes, suppression of unwelcome speech and all the attendant snowflakery on college campuses deserve a passionate challenge, but there are plenty of others who could make the case for intellectual diversity without engaging the perverse. Clearly, Schlapp wanted a glitzy headliner to draw a crowd. This isn’t a criminal offense, but it might be craven. This year’s CPAC suggests a certain desperation to be relevant and the unwinding of core conservative principles, which can’t be separated from the imperative to seek out and exercise our better angels. If the brilliance of your ideas won’t draw a crowd, then maybe you need better ideas. Meanwhile, the ACU, the oldest conservative lobbying organization in the country, has betrayed the greats of conservative thought and tradition and become just another political party, trading its heraldic mission for money, fame and power.  It’s an old story  —   still and always sad.  Read more from Kathleen Parker’s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.

            "Message: Decades-old letters belonging to President Obama’s father are discovered in Harlem      An archivist has discovered a rare collection of more than two dozen letters and documents from President Obama’s father that were written more than a   ago as he was trying to make his way in the United States. The discovery of the yellowing letters in which Barack Hussein Obama Sr. is trying to secure financial assistance from U. S. universities and foundations was made in 2013, and was first reported by the New York Times on Saturday. The documents were found at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem and describe the elder Obama’s journey from Kenya to the University of Hawaii and then on to Harvard University for graduate studies.   [Obama mourns Orlando victims, then keeps moving]   ”It has been my long cherished ambition to further my studies in America,” he wrote in 1958, according to one of the letters reproduced by the New York Times. It was in Hawaii as a student that the elder Obama met and married Ann Dunham, a classmate and President Obama’s mother. At the time, the elder Obama had already married and had two children in Kenya, a fact that he kept from his American wife and son. The letters, transcripts and documents portray President Obama’s father as a bright and driven young man who was widely admired by his professors for his work ethic and intellect. In some of the letters, he complains about the high cost of food in the United States, including a   hamburger, and his isolation from his home in Africa. The documents also hint at the elder Obama’s darker side. He fails to mention his American wife and son on the financial aid forms he filled out when applying for grants to help pay for his graduate studies at Harvard. He left the section on marital status and dependents blank. The Schomburg Center, which is part of the New York Public Library System, acquired the elder Obama’s papers from an aid and scholarship granting organization, said Adenike Olanrewaju, a spokeswoman for the library system. They were uncovered by Christine McKay, an archivist who was doing research in 2013. The library invited the president to see the newly discovered documents shortly after they were discovered in 2013, but it never received a response, Olanrewaju said.   [A virtual museum of the Obama presidency]   The letters end in 1964, when the elder Obama returned to Kenya, leaving behind his    son. The president saw his father just once more, when he was 10, and the two spent a month together in Hawaii. Obama’s memoir, ”Dreams From My Father,” chronicles the president’s struggle to understand the father who abandoned him and his own identity. In an interview last year with comedian Marc Maron, Obama described his father as a ”brilliant man   …     who took a leap from a tiny village in the backwaters of Kenya” to the the United States. ”He never managed that leap as well as he could have,” Obama said. ”And part of the process of me writing the book was to figure out what happened to him and how did he become who he was.” Obama said that for most of his childhood, his father was an ”abstraction.” His mother and grandparents accentuated the good in his absent father, the president said. Later in life, the elder Obama ”ended up becoming an alcoholic and abusive towards his several wives, and to some degree, a neglectful father,” the president told Maron. Throughout his time in the White House, the president has made a point of having dinner with his family whenever possible  —   a commitment that he has suggested has hindered his ability to build close relationships in Washington. His elder daughter, Malia, recently graduated from Sidwell Friends School in Washington, and Obama has said that he will stay in the city for two years so that his younger daughter, Sasha, can finish high school. ”One of the things that I always say is  —   I’ve said this to Michelle  —   one of our biggest jobs as parents  —   because we’re all a little bit crazy  —   is let’s see if we can not pass on some of our craziness to our kids,” he told Maron. ”That’s a challenge, right?” Maron said with a laugh. ”Let’s see if we can break the cycle,” Obama replied.  \n",

            "Message: Naming of new Taliban chief seen dimming Obama’s hopes for Afghan peace talks  (This version of the May 26 story has been refiled to fix spelling in paragraph 2) By Jonathan Landay and Idrees Ali  The selection of a   cleric as the new Taliban chief on Wednesday all but dashes U. S. President Barack Obama’s hopes for opening peace talks before he leaves office, one of his top foreign policy goals, current and former U. S. defense and intelligence officials said. The Taliban leadership council tapped Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, a conservative Islamic scholar from the group’s stronghold in southern Afghanistan, to succeed Mullah Akhtar Mansour, four days after Mansour was killed in a U. S. drone strike. U. S. officials had called Mansour a major impediment to peace talks, and some had expressed hope his death would eliminate an obstacle to peace negotiations between the Taliban and the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Instead, some experts said, Akhundzada is likely to pursue aggressive attacks throughout the summer, intensifying the pressure on Obama to reconsider his plan to withdraw U. S. military trainers and special forces and leave the decision on how to end America’s longest war to his successor. Late last year, Obama announced he would keep 9, 800 U. S. military personnel in Afghanistan through most of 2016. He added that U. S. troops would be drawn down to 5, 500 by the start of 2017. Obama has made extracting the United States from its   war in Afghanistan a top priority, unsuccessfully pursuing efforts to bring the Taliban into talks with successive Afghan governments. ”Prospects for the Afghan peace process remain poor. The Taliban leadership, including the new commander, Mullah Akhundzada, believe military victory is only a matter of time,” said Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution expert and former CIA officer who headed Obama’s first Afghanistan policy review. Riedel said Pakistan’s powerful   Intelligence agency also believed that the Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan for five years before their ouster in a U. S.  invasion in 2001, could win a military victory. ”The war is entering a more violent phase,” he added, his prediction punctuated by a suicide bombing in Kabul that killed 11 people shortly after Akhundzada’s selection was announced. TROOP PLAN UNDER REVIEW Confronted with Taliban gains, a weak Kabul government and the emergence of an Islamic State branch, the top U. S. commander in Afghanistan is reviewing the withdrawal plan and is expected to complete his findings within a month. The administration remains committed to its strategy of pressing for peace talks while providing funds and military advice, training and equipment to Afghan forces, said Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who indicated the U. S. troop drawdown would resume.  The Taliban should realize ”that they cannot win, that the Afghan security forces aided by us are going to be stronger than them and are going to be able to defend the state of Afghanistan and the government of national unity there, and therefore that the alternative to coming across and making peace with the government is their certain defeat on the battlefield,” Carter said on Wednesday in Rhode Island. But current and former U. S. government experts and independent analysts said they saw little chance of that happening, with one U. S. defense official noting the Taliban announcement of Akhundzada’s accession made no mention of negotiations. ’WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN SMOKING?’ “Whenever I hear anyone in the administration talking about the prospects for peace negotiations or how killing Mullah Mansour could improve them, I have to ask what they’ve been smoking,” a U. S. military officer with extensive experience in Afghanistan, said on condition of anonymity. ”Regardless of who leads them, the Taliban have zero incentive to negotiate on their determination to restore their brand of Islamic rule.” He and other U. S. military and intelligence officials pointed out that the Taliban had been making steady battlefield gains against Afghan security forces, who have been suffering high casualty rates. Moreover, the coalition government brokered by the United States between Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, his former rival and now the country’s chief executive, is riddled by disputes and deeply unpopular. The insurgents have little reason to trust the coalition government or Obama’s successor, who takes office in January, to keep any agreement, said a U. S. official with experience in Afghanistan.  (Reporting by Jonathan Landay, Idrees Ali, Yeganeh Torbati and John Walcott; Editing by John Walcott and Peter Cooney) DOHA Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbors, but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement.     forces edged into the final redoubts of the two capitals of Islamic State’s   caliphate in Iraq and Syria on Tuesday, hampered by fierce resistance from the militants and the presence of human shields. \n",

            "Message: With Rogue One, the Star Wars Franchise Gets Even More Feminist Mild spoilers ahead.  In May of 1977, in New York magazine, John Simon reviewed the new George Lucas film, Star Wars. Simon was not a fan. “It is all trite characters and paltry verbiage,” the critic wrote of the   film, “handled adequately by Harrison Ford as a   starship pilot, uninspiredly by Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker (Luke for George Lucas, the   Skywalker for his Icarus complex) and wretchedly by Carrie Fisher, who is not even appealing as Princess Leia Organa (an organic lay). ” An organic lay. It’s a good reminder, by way of a bad joke, of how far American culture has come since 1977 —  and also of the time that the Star Wars saga has spanned, not just in its own (far) faraway galaxies, but also in the one its viewers share. The original Star Wars was, in its time, progressive Leia, who was not just a princess but also a rebel and fighter and a leader, was smart and feisty and   —  a Strong Female Lede for the time before that designation would become a category and a cliché. Leia was also, though, the heroine who squirmed in that (in) famous metal bikini and desperately uttered the line, “Help me,   Kenobi, you’re my only hope. ” Leia is a great character, undeniably, a model for Katniss and Ripley and Imperator Furiosa as a feminist one, though, she has been decidedly fraught. Much less fraught is the heroine of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) has been forged in the   mold of the heroes who have been defined by their separation from their parents, and she is a natural leader who is not at all a princess. She is a soldier, not just by training and circumstance but also by inclination. She is tough, but kind she is hardened, but human. She is, as Leia —  and as, for that matter, the Star Wars denizens Padmé and Rey —  have been before her, both a product and a reflection of her times. Jyn is a feminist heroine who is uniquely at home within the feminism of 2016. First of all, and most obviously: Jyn is the star of this Star Wars story. It is her story, fundamentally: She is the axis around which everything else spins. That’s unique because, while the Star Wars franchise has emphasized and exploited the power of the ensemble, its previous installments have all, in some way, revolved around    couples: Leia and Luke, Leia and Han, Padmé and Anakin, Rey and Finn. Rogue One has very little of that kind of elemental pairing. There are duos in it, yes —  Jyn and her father, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) Jyn and her   caretaker, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) Jyn and her fellow rebels, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) —  but none of them define the movie. That is because, simply but powerfully, it is Jyn who defines the movie. Rogue One and the Challenge of the New( ish) Rogue One also goes out of its way to poke fun at one of the themes that ran through the canonical Star Wars films: the notion of rescuing. “Congratulations, you are being rescued,” the droid   tells Jyn, as she is thwarted in an escape attempt after being captured early on in the film. “Please do not resist. ” It’s one of the few great lines of Rogue One, and it’s great precisely because of its knowingness: Jyn, it has already become clear, is not the kind of heroine who needs rescuing. She, instead, is the kind of heroine who rescues others. She is no damsel even when things get dire, we do not see her in distress. We also see Jyn, repeatedly, running and climbing and   and basically doing what she needs to do to complete the mission she and her fellow rebels set out to get done. She does that easily, in part, because her clothes are fit to her purpose. Rogue One reads, among other things, as a rebuke to the costumes of Jyn’s fellow Star Wars women: the vaguely Grecian dresses the   white Spandex the convenient rip in the midriff of the   white Spandex the layered robes the skimpy bikini. These fanciful outfits have been replaced, in Jyn and on her, by an insistently practical uniform: pants that are neither too loose nor too tight, a jacket, clunky combat boots, and a shawl that doubles as a scarf and a head covering. All of them come in drab shades of brown and gray. It’s a costuming choice that reflects what might be the most progressive element of Rogue One: the fact that the film features almost none of the romantic subplotting that has helped to carry, and add charm to, the canonical Star Wars films. There’s a moment, at the very end of Rogue One, that casts Jyn roughly as a romantic heroine the brief scene comes almost as a throwaway, though, and ends up scanning more as evidence of shared moral purpose than of attraction or romantic love. Those things, the film suggests, have very little place in this particular Star Wars story. Rogue One, indeed, is an almost asexual movie —  not in the       manner of Padmé and Anakin in the Star Wars prequels, but rather in a           manner of wartime. Rogue One forecloses the possibility of romance this, too, is progressive. This, too, is suggestive of how far the Star Wars franchise —  and how far the rest of us, along with it —  have come since the heady spring of 1977.\n",

            "Message: The Science Behind The Super Abilities Of Sherpas Sherpas are extraordinary human beings. In the high peaks of the Himalayas, members of the Nepalese ethnic group are famous for their   records, ascents of routes that no one has ascended before, expert guiding and other skills. What makes Sherpas so good at climbing into the wispy atmosphere of the world’s tallest mountains? They may be better at harnessing oxygen than the rest of us, suggests a new study, which also offers insights that could eventually help ordinary people whose tissues become deprived of oxygen because of medical conditions. ”You don’t need to spend very long in that part of world to see that the people living there, particularly the Sherpas, perform extremely well at altitude  —   a lot better than we do,” says Andrew Murray, a physiologist at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and one of the study’s authors. ”There’s certainly something really remarkable about their ability.” The study adds to evidence that their genes play a role. The Sherpas and other ethnic groups have lived on the high plateau of the Himalayas at an average altitude of more than 14, 700 feet going back at least 6, 000 years. But life at such high altitudes remains inhospitable for most of us. People from low altitudes who travel or move to higher elevations face multiple risks: with access to limited oxygen above 8, 000 feet or so, symptoms often include headaches, low appetite and trouble sleeping. Severe cases of mountain sickness can cause swelling in the brain, a condition called High Altitude Cerebral Edema, or fluid in the lungs, called High Altitude Pulmonary Edema. Both conditions can quickly become deadly. Pregnant women also suffer higher rates of miscarriage and other complications because of higher blood pressure at altitude  —   which illustrates the potential for evolution to favor genes that help mountain people cope with oxygen deprivation. So how do the Sherpas do it? Over thousands of years, the bodies of   dwellers have developed ways to make the most of oxygen, Murray says. When most of us climb, a hormone in our bodies called erythropoietin (EPO) triggers the production of more red blood cells, which can then carry more oxygen to our muscles. But the extra cells also thicken our blood, which puts extra stress on the heart to pump it and can cause symptoms of altitude sickness. Sherpas increase their red blood cell count at altitude, too, but not nearly as much as people from lower down do. To better understand how Sherpas manage to perform so well, even without help from a surge in extra   red blood cells, Murray and colleagues studied a group of 15 Sherpas and 10 lowlanders on an expedition to Everest Base Camp in 2013. None of the participants were allowed to climb to extreme altitudes in the weeks leading up to the study, which began with a flight from either London or Kathmandu to Lukla, Nepal, at nearly 9, 200 feet. All of the participants were offered the same food as they trekked for 10 days to Everest Base Camp at nearly 17, 400 feet. Before, during and after the trek, the researchers took blood samples as well as   chunks of muscle from everyone. Interesting differences showed up in the muscle cells of the two groups, the team reported this past week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In the muscles of the Sherpas, the study found, the cells’ mitochondria (the   parts) converted more oxygen into energy. ”The Sherpas’ mitochondria were less leaky and therefore more efficient than the Westerners’ mitochondria,” Murray says. ”They were better at using oxygen.” Like a small,   car that has a smaller gas tank than a   4x4, he says, the Sherpas’ muscles are capable of getting more mileage out of less total oxygen. The Sherpas were also able to produce more energy without any oxygen at all, a process called anaerobic metabolism. Together, the findings help connect the dots from previous research that has revealed intriguing mutations in the DNA of Sherpas, says Tatum Simonson, who studies the genetics and physiology of high altitude adaptations at the University of California, San Diego. For a 2010 study, she and colleagues scanned the genomes of Tibetan people living at high altitudes and found a handful of genes with distinct mutations that appeared to be related to oxygen metabolism and adapted to a   environment. By probing deeper into the potential role of one of those genes (which also appears in people of Ethiopian ancestry who live at high altitude) Murray’s group has built off her work ”and taken it many steps further,” Simonson says. ”I think this is one of the first studies that has actually done that. I was so excited to see this paper.” The study shows that the metabolisms of lowlanders and Sherpas work in similar ways at low altitudes, suggesting that gene differences between Sherpas and lowlanders kick in at high altitudes, she adds. ”But then, when you push the system by exposing them to low oxygen, you start to see differences between populations.” Because Sherpas have adapted to high altitudes over hundreds of generations, Simonson says, they offer a window into the potential of the human body to deal with oxygen deprivation. The same gene variations that help Sherpas cope with a meager oxygen supply also show up occasionally in the general population, Simonson says. So studies like this one might eventually help explain why some people deal better with hypoxia, or low oxygen levels in their tissues, as a result of both high altitudes and medical conditions like heart disease, respiratory disease and cancer. In hospitals, as many as 25 percent of people with hypoxia die, Murray says, and those who survive don’t recover their previous quality of life. Treatment has traditionally focused on increasing oxygen levels however possible, but that strategy often doesn’t work and may even cause harm. Perhaps it would work better to develop drug treatments that would enable patients to mimic what the Sherpas are doing, Murray says  —   use the oxygen they do have access to more efficiently. ”Instead of trying to get their oxygen levels up and potentially damage patients, is there something we can do to make them more tolerant to that stress?” he asks. ”Hopefully, there will be huge medical implications.” Emily Sohn is a freelance journalist in Minneapolis who writes regularly about health and science for Nature, the Washington Post, bioGraphic, Hakai and others.

            "Message: Trump And Company Prepare Inaugural Address In The Shadow Of Tradition   Trump is busy these days with victory tours,   and foreign policy tweets. But he’s also finding time to think about his inauguration. He huddled this week with presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who later told CNN they had discussed the inaugural addresses of previous presidents. Brinkley emerged from the    at    resort in Florida to say Trump was not planning a   on Jan. 20. ”He doesn’t want it to be long,” Brinkley told CNN. ”He doesn’t want people standing out in the cold.” In other words, Brinkley added, he doesn’t want to be like William Henry Harrison, who in 1841 gave the longest inaugural speech ever (an hour and 45 minutes in a snowstorm) and served the shortest time in the White House, dying of pneumonia one month after the speech. That disaster aside, the inaugural address has become a major feature of a new presidency, thanks in large part to the mass media of the 20th century. But at the very beginning, the remarks were delivered not to an adoring throng of supporters but a gaggle of congressmen and other officials. Perhaps that is why George Washington did not feel required to inspire with his opening line at his first inauguration in 1789. To wit: ”Among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, received on the 14th day of this month.” Some of that humility persisted four years later when Washington penned his second inaugural address. Just 135 words, it remains the shortest inaugural to this day. The inaugural addresses we often remember best were those delivered at the worst times in our national history. Most everyone has heard at least some of the speech Abraham Lincoln worked for weeks writing in 1861. With war between the states looming, the new president tried desperately to slow the spread of disunion. ”We are not enemies, but friends,” Lincoln concluded. ”We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.” Stirring words to be sure, but not successful. Secessionist forces would fire on the federal Fort Sumter in South Carolina the next month, and four years of civil war would follow. In the depths of the Great Depression in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to translate his landslide election into new confidence for the nation as he intoned the words: ”The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Roosevelt went on to decry ”nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” And he added a note of hope: ”In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.” FDR himself found a great deal of support, winning   three times. But the depression lingered through the decade and was only surmounted with the onset of World War II. No president has taken the oath in such dire circumstances since, but several inaugural addresses have been regarded as pivotal. According to Brinkley, Trump himself mentioned the speeches by John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Many were inspired by Kennedy’s iconic performance in 1961. The youngest person ever elected president, Kennedy at 43 seemed to embody the spirit of his times with his address: ”Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans  —   born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage . ..” Moving as those words were, they were eclipsed by the exhortation that came after: ”And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” A generation of his fellow Americans would do just that, in the military, in the Peace Corps, and in countless other forms of public service. Few may have realized at the time, but Kennedy’s shining words were not entirely his own. Roosevelt and other presidents had depended on staff and advisers in composing their speeches. But with Kennedy there emerged the speechwriter as star in the person of Ted Sorensen. Sorensen had joined Kennedy’s team in 1953, the year the future president entered the Senate. Sorensen had been raised and educated in Nebraska, but he had an immediate rapport with the scion of the   Kennedy clan. The   Midwesterner would have a hand in nearly all Kennedy’s most famous utterances  —   including the book Profiles in Courage, for which the senator was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. Sorensen himself always downplayed his own role, denying authorship. In an interview with NPR’s Scott Simon in 2009, at the age of 81, Sorensen had this to say: ”Let’s just say that my work over an   period with John F. Kennedy was a collaborative process, and I would not remember now who provided one word or one line. But John F. Kennedy was the author of his inaugural address because he’s the man who made the decisions on what policies and values to enunciate.” Ronald Reagan was renowned for his speaking prowess long before he became president, although he too had speechwriters he relied upon  —   including longtime California politico Ken Khachigian. In his inaugural address in 1981, Reagan strove to put a postscript to the politics of FDR and JFK with this pithy judgment: ”In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem.” In Reagan’s later years, one of his writers gained considerable profile in her own right. Peggy Noonan would also write major speeches for the first President Bush. Noonan went on to be a newspaper columnist, as did Michael Gerson, who gained a measure of fame writing for the second President Bush. Among Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were known for their way with words. Obama in particular rose to national prominence as a speechmaker. But both also had numerous writers with whom they worked. Which brings us to the present day and the case of   Trump. Brinkley reported that Trump told him he’d started working on his address and planned to produce it himself. But his transition team has said he is also working with Stephen Miller, a former Senate staffer for Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions who has been on the Trump campaign staff for more than a year. At 31, Miller is a year younger than Sorensen was when Kennedy took the oath. Raised in Southern California, he came east to attend Duke University before coming to work for Sessions. Like Sorensen, Miller is very much a policy adviser as well as a wordsmith  —   motivated by the immigration issue in particular. Miller often spoke at Trump rallies during 2016, whipping up the crowd with harsh attacks on Hillary Clinton before Trump stepped on stage. He is also credited with drafting the acceptance speech Trump gave at the Republican Convention in July, a speech widely regarded as an indictment of life in the current U. S. a dark description of the nation’s economic, social and cultural condition. But Miller is also said to have provided the prepared remarks Trump sometimes used on the stump in the fall  —   remarks that kept the candidate ”on message” and minimized   controversy in the campaign’s final days. If Miller is indeed a major contributor to the Trump inaugural address, which Miller is likely to shine through? The crowd outside the West Front of the Capitol that day will be larger than any Trump rally to date, with tens of millions more watching around the world. And the Trump transition team has said the tone of the day will be uplift. Whatever the tone or the message, history tells us the first day of the Trump presidency will be remembered largely for the words the new president speaks.\n",

            "Message: Religious Conservatives and Donald Trump — the Cheapest Date in Politics? Hillary Clinton’s nomination speech at the Democratic National Convention put a capstone on perhaps the worst political week for religious conservatives in living memory. It began a week ago at Republican convention, where one featured speaker mocked the “fake culture wars” and the   GOP nominee didn’t even deign to mention abortion and confined his support of religious liberty to the right of pastors to politic from the pulpit  —   hardly the most burning issue of our time. The hits kept coming as the Libertarian party’s Gary Johnson foreclosed the possibility of a meaningful protest vote by breaking with decades of libertarian orthodoxy to declare that religious freedom “as a category” is a “black hole. ” His extended remarks are, in fact,  : I mean under the guise of religious freedom, anybody can do anything. Back to Mormonism. Why shouldn’t somebody be able to shoot somebody else because their freedom of religion says that God has spoken to them and that they can shoot somebody dead? There’s a word for this  —   idiotic. That’s the kind of reasoning one hears from freshman campus radicals, not from   former governors, and it betrays not only a complete history of centuries of   jurisprudence but also a hostility to people of faith that’s simply breathtaking. So, no, Gary Johnson isn’t a viable choice, religious conservatives. Then, of course, came the Democratic Convention and Hillary Clinton. While Hillary certainly made a play for voters who are terrified of Donald Trump, her message to religious conservatives was clear  —   the culture war continues. She supports   abortion on demand and will doubtless double down on the LGBT social revolution. The liberty and autonomy of churches, religious schools, and religious individuals is in grave peril. In other words, when it comes to the culture war, the Democrats’ message is “charge!” The Republican message is “retreat!” And the Libertarian nominee quite simply seems to hate Christians. Share article on FacebookshareTweet It’s time to consider the long game. A vote for Hillary is lunacy. She’ll take Christians’ votes, use them to build a mandate, and then use that mandate to undermine religious liberty and advance a culture of death. A vote for Trump is a declaration that people of faith are the cheapest date in the history of American politics. A political movement built through decades of argument that faith, family, and respect for life are the cornerstones of our culture can’t throw away its political capital on the altar of a man who  —   best case  —   simply doesn’t care and  —   worst case  —   will wreck the Christian political witness by tying their support to a dangerous,   pathological liar. RELATED: The American Church Needs to Get Serious about Religious Liberty, Now, There is an alternative. Christians can preserve their witness  —   and maintain their political capital  —   by voting only for those candidates who demonstrate sincere commitment to life and religious liberty. That means fighting to preserve conservative congressional majorities and using their platforms to elevate politicians of sincere conviction to prepare for the next campaign season. The message should be clear  —   if you’re not with us, you’re not winning. We know the Democrats will continue to undermine people of faith regardless of conservative Christian votes. If even a man like Donald Trump can count on Evangelicals, then the GOP will feel free to pursue power without regard to constitutional principle, content in the knowledge that its faithful Christian puppies will eagerly follow  —   wagging their tails at even the thought of crumbs from the table. The   Left has such a stranglehold on the Democratic party that for decades the Democrats have staked out extreme positions on abortion and enforced absolute discipline on judicial picks. The Democratic culture warriors simply do not consent to compromise, much less surrender. More Religious Freedom Legal Radicals Don’t Want the ‘Separation of Church and State’Three Thoughts on the Masterpiece Cakeshop Cert GrantReligious Liberty, Trump Win Important Victories at the Supreme CourtOn the right, meanwhile, you will actually see religious conservatives act indignant at people of faith who balk at supporting a man who declares that Planned Parenthood does “wonderful things” and attacked dissenters as “  conservatives. ” They’re indignant at the notion that Christians would turn away from a man who demonstrates aggressive, persistent ignorance on economic and foreign policy because there’s a chance  —   just a chance  —   that he might nominate a decent Supreme Court justice. They’re indignant that faithful Christians who’ve long called for integrity in politics won’t support a man who’s demonstrated faithlessness to his family and indifference to the truth. Honestly, it’s pitiful. Is the Christian conservative movement so weak and so insecure that it will throw away its vote so easily? A vote for Trump is a declaration of irrelevance, a declaration that Christian support is unconditional so long as one can argue that the other side is marginally worse. The cultural Left shows no such weakness. Not coincidentally, it is winning. The Christian Right would do well to learn from its opponents’ resolve.,\n",

            "Message: Grandma accidentally invites stranger to Thanksgiving - and it gets better  (CNN) There’s nothing like having a home cooked meal from grandma during the holidays. Even if it’s not from your own grandma. A woman in Mesa, Arizona, sent a text message to tell her grandson Thanksgiving dinner would be at her house at 3 p. m. this year. But she accidentally sent it to the wrong number.  Jamal Hinton, 17,  was in class at Desert Vista High School when his phone went off with the invitation.  ”I texted back and I said ’who is this?’ And she was like, ’it’s your grandma.’ Hinton told CNN affiliate KNXV. He assumed his grandma had a new number, so to be sure, he asked her to send him a picture.  The woman sent back a selfie Hinton didn’t recognize.  So Hinton responded back with his own photo, showing that he was not her grandson. But he was sure to ask if he could still grab a plate of Thanksgiving dinner.  To his surprise, she replied,  ”Of course you can. That’s what grandmas do. ..feed everyone!” Overwhelmed by the woman’s kindness, Jamal posted the exchange online. But he forgot to remove her number from the screenshots.  So, according to The Arizona Republic, the grandma received about 600 text messages asking for a Thanksgiving plate.  The woman, who didn’t want to be named, had to change her number but stayed connected with Hinton so she could send him her address. He’s still welcome. Hinton told KNXV, ”People can actually connect and be so nice to each other with people they don’t even know.” It’s an act of kindness that fills both Hinton’s stomach and heart. \n",

            "Message: Berlin attack: Police hunt Tunisian suspect Berlin (CNN) A manhunt is underway for a    Tunisia native in connection with this week’s Christmas market attack in Berlin    a man German authorities say may be ”violent and armed” and had been in contact with radical Islamist groups. Anis Amri is being sought in Monday’s truck attack, which left 12 people dead and 48 injured at Breitsheidplatz, a wanted notice issued Wednesday by the German federal prosecutor’s office said.  Police have offered a reward of up to 100, 000 euros (about $104, 000) for information about his whereabouts, and said Amri is ”under urgent suspicion.” ”If you see this person that we are seeking, inform the police. Please do not put yourself in danger because this person could be violent and armed!” the notice said. Latest developments, • Amri is 1. 78 meters (5 feet 10 inches) tall and weighs about 75 kilograms (165 pounds). • The suspect was arrested in August with forged documents en route to Italy, but a judge released him, an official says. •  Police at one point noticed the suspect because he was looking for a gun. •  The suspect arrived in Germany in 2015 and was known to be in touch with radical Islamist groups, a state minister says. •  The suspect’s asylum request was refused this year and deportation was attempted, state minister says. •  German police conduct raids in North   region, a security official says. Hunt for suspect, Amri’s identity papers were found inside the cabin of the truck used in Monday’s attack, German security officials said.  Before Amri was publicly named, Ralf Jaeger, interior minister of North   told reporters the suspect was known to German security services as someone in contact with radical Islamist groups, and had been assessed as posing a risk.  One German security official told CNN the suspect had been arrested in August with forged documents in the southern German town of Friedrichshafen, on his way to Italy, but a judge released him. The suspect also came onto the radar of German police because he was looking for a gun, the official said.  Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière told reporters a manhunt had been underway across Europe since midnight. German police carried out raids Wednesday in connection with the investigation in North   where Amri had stayed, another security official told CNN.  ISIS claimed it had inspired Monday’s attack. The terror group’s affiliated Amaq News Agency described the perpetrator as a ”soldier of the Islamic State” who had acted in response to calls for attacks in the West.  Amri was named as a suspect a day after police released a different man. The first man, an asylum seeker believed to be from Pakistan, had been detained in the immediate aftermath of the attack, with German media reporting that witnesses had said he’d driven the truck. But Peter Frank, general prosecutor at Germany’s Federal Court of Justice, said that forensic tests offered no link between the man and the truck’s cabin. Link to   network? Jaeger said Amri was believed to have entered Germany in July 2015 and had traveled between Berlin, North   and other cities. He was ”very mobile,” but was mostly in Berlin since February, he said.  Amri requested asylum in Germany, but this was refused in June, Jaeger said    two months before his reported arrest in southern Germany. A deportation process was started in North   Jaeger said. The suspect had been registered by German authorities as someone who posed a risk, said Stephan Mayer, a spokesman for the Christian Democratic   Social Union parliamentary group. Mayer said the suspect was believed to have links to a Salafist group, referring to an   branch of Islam. But authorities’ attempts to deport him were thwarted because they were unable to establish his identity beyond doubt, Mayer said.  German security officials told CNN that investigators believe the Tunisian suspect is linked to a recruitment network for ISIS operating in Germany. The main figure in the network, Ahmad Abdulaziz Abdullah    a    Iraqi national also known as Abu Walaa    and four others were arrested and charged with terrorism offenses in November.  German federal prosecutors said then that Abdullah was the ringleader of a multiregional recruitment network. The group allegedly targeted and radicalized young Muslims in North   and Lower Saxony. Jaeger said he could not confirm a link to Abu Walaa. Tunisian radio network Mosaique FM interviewed a man who identified himself as Amri’s father. The man said Anis is one of four children, and that he and Amri’s mother are divorced.  Amri left Tunisia for Italy about seven years ago, after he dropped out of school, the man said. The man said he hasn’t heard from Amri but that Amri maintained contact with his siblings through phone calls that sometimes came months apart.  Original truck driver slain, A Polish man found shot dead inside the truck has been identified as its original driver, according to German media. He was not driving during the incident, police said. The gun used to kill him has not been recovered.  The slain driver may have been involved in a struggle with the suspect inside the truck’s cabin before he was shot, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. This could be when the suspect’s identity papers were dropped, he suggested. The truck, which was owned by a Polish company, was hauling 25 tons of steel before it was steered into the crowd, according to its owner, Ariel Zurawski. He identified the slain driver as his cousin.  Police have appealed to the public for any digital videos and photos they have of the attack or possible suspects.  ’Like a little war zone’  German authorities have not publicly named any of the victims, and police have asked people not to post videos or photos of them as a sign of respect. But Israel’s Foreign Ministry said Thursday that a    Israeli woman    Dalia Elaykim    had died in the attack. Her husband was seriously injured. The embassy is working with the family to bring her body back to Israel for burial, the Ministry said. Italy’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Italian national Fabrizia Di Lorenzo was missing following the attack and that her family was now in Berlin. The ministry said it was waiting for German investigators to complete their work before issuing a statement. Italy’s ANSA news agency reported the missing woman, 31, worked in Berlin and that her cell phone was found at the attack scene. Michael Schuetz, the doctor who oversaw the emergency response at Berlin’s Charité hospital, told CNN that survivors described a scene ”like a little war zone.” Physical injuries ranged from major trauma for those hit by the truck to lesser injuries suffered when poles from the market huts fell on people, he said. Dueling protests, Berliners who came to leave flowers and candles at makeshift shrines near the Christmas market told CNN Wednesday they would not allow the attack to change the way they led their lives. One handwritten note left with a bunch of roses read, ”You will not have our hate,” echoing the words of writer Antoine Leiris after he lost his wife in the Paris attacks. Wednesday night, the issue of migrants drew dueling protests outside the Berlin Zoo rail station. On one side a few dozen people joined a demonstration by the   ultranationalist National Democratic Party, waving German flags and railing against the acceptance of migrants and refugees. They were countered by a group of several hundred people, many of whom shouted: ”Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here!” Some in the counterdemonstration carried white signs with red hearts printed on them. Signs carried messages such as ”Solidarity instead of hate,” and ”Together against Nazis.” As the NPD side delivered speeches on a loudspeaker, the counterdemonstrators drowned them out with music, chants and whistles. Among the   crowd was    Irmela Schramm, who for years has sought out   graffiti across Germany and painted over it with heart shapes.  ”When I saw what happened on Monday, I knew I would have a lot more to do,” she said Wednesday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has come under political pressure over her government’s generous acceptance of refugees. Germany has taken in more than 890, 000   in the past year, a much higher number than other European nations.

He just added a new   program to the curriculum, starting in the fall, which he views as an alternative to a master’s degree.” ’This is in addition to the school’’s classic two months of ”hero training” offered since it launched three years ago.’ ”There’s a reason he calls it hero training. Before you can become the next Steve Jobs, you have to learn to be tough. Navy SEAL tough.” ’Hero training includes ”four days of survival training with military teams. We have Navy SEAL special forces and Army Rangers that take them to real survival training,” Draper says.’ ’Once students have spent those days foraging for food and shelter in the wilderness, the next step is city survival training, challenges that sound like what Donald Trump gave to contestants on his reality show, ”The Apprentice. ”’ ’”There’’s another couple of days in the two months of hero training that’’s Urban Survival training,” Draper says.

            "Message: For years, immigration authorities gave this mother a pass. On Wednesday, when she checked in with them, they seized her.          About eight years ago, there was a knock on Guadalupe García de Rayos’s door. Authorities had come to arrest the undocumented mother of two U. S.  children, a Mexican native who had lived north of the border since she was 14. The Phoenix mother was detained for months and eventually ordered to be sent back to Mexico. But for the subsequent years, after she appealed her voluntary deportation, García de Rayos was allowed to remain in the United States, as long as she checked in once a year, and then every six months. Each year, she followed suit, and each year, immigration officials let her stay. This year, as García de Rayos feared, was different. When she went to check in as usual at the central Phoenix offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she was taken into custody as protests erupted outside. García de Rayos could perhaps be among the first undocumented immigrants to be arrested during a scheduled meeting with immigration officials since President Trump’s inauguration, civil rights lawyers told the New York Times.   [VIDEO: Young, undocumented and worried about her future]   Having anticipated the mother’s possible detention, the group Puente Arizona had organized a rally outside the offices, and crowds swelled to about 200 people at the peak of the gathering, the Arizona Republic reported. Protesters, including de Rayos’ two children, shouted, “No papers, no fear” and “Let her go, set her free,” as others banged on drums and raised posters and flags. For several hours, demonstrators blocked an ICE van with García de Rayos inside  —   one man even tied himself to one of the van’s front wheels. It was unclear whether the van was taking García de Rayos and other deportees to Mexico or to detention. Seven protesters were arrested, but the majority of the demonstration was peaceful, Phoenix police tweeted.   Besides the few people engaged in criminal acts, most people out here are peaceful and exercising their rights properly.  —   Phoenix Police (@phoenixpolice) February 9, 2017   García de Rayos’s detention is likely to mark a shift in deportation priorities under Trump. Previously, the Obama administration prioritized the deportation of people who were violent offenders or had ties to criminal gangs. Trump’s executive order on Jan. 25 expanded priorities to include any undocumented immigrants who had been convicted of a criminal offense.   [The long struggle over what to call ‘undocumented immigrants’ or, as Trump said in his order, ‘illegal aliens’]   In a statement, ICE officials said García de Rayos was detained based on a removal order issued by the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which became final in May 2013, and was spurred by a prior felony conviction dating from March 2009 for criminal impersonation. The conviction stems from one of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s worksite raids targeting the Golfland Entertainment Centers, which operated several water and   parks. Sheriff’s deputies seized hundreds of employment records and later arrested García de Rayos at her house, the Arizona Republic reported. She pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal impersonation, a Class 6 felony, the lowest level. After being arrested and turned over to ICE, García de Rayos spent six months at the Eloy Detention Center. She is now fighting to have her felony conviction thrown out on grounds that Arpaio’s worksite raids were unconstitutional. Puente Arizona filed a lawsuit in 2015 to end Arpaio’s raids, an     tactic that has led to the arrests of hundreds of immigrant workers since 2008. “It has 100 percent to do with the executive order,” said Ray   a Phoenix immigration lawyer who is representing García de Rayos, told the Arizona Republic.    A protester locked himself to the van carrying Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos that is stopped by protesters outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. (Rob   Republic via Associated Press)    immediately filed documents asking ICE to stay her deportation, on the basis that she has lived in the United States since she was 14, has two children who are U. S. citizens and is fighting to have her felony conviction overturned, he told reporters.  The protesters said that they initially stopped the vehicles from leaving, but that they later left the grounds by another exit, the Associated Press reported. They didn’t know if García de Rayos was still in the vehicle. Carlos García, the director of Puente, told the Arizona Republic that he thinks ICE’s decision to take García de Rayos into custody will spur other undocumented immigrants who have been released on supervision to stop checking in and go into hiding. “Most definitely, if what’s going to happen when people come to check in they are going to get detained and deported, I would assume most people will not turn themselves in,” he said. When asked what she would tell Trump if she had the chance, García de Rayos’ daughter Jaqueline, 14, told reporters, “I’d ask him why he would want to take her from me. She hasn’t done anything wrong and I’m not scared of him. ” Asked how long she planned to stay, Jaqueline had a simple answer, the Arizona Republic reported: “Until I get my mom back. ” More from Morning Mix:  What’s largely and glaringly missing from Trump’s list of terrorist attacks:   victims Spicer claims he ‘clearly meant Orlando’ after citing mystery Atlanta terrorist attack three times The silencing of Elizabeth Warren and an old Senate rule prompted by a fistfight\n",

            "Message: Now Republicans want to undo the regulations that helped consumers and stabilized banking  With the debacle of health care reform in the rearview window, conservatives in Congress and the White House are turning their sights on President Barack Obama’s financial regulations. All indications are that the GOP is more unified in how they want to go about “repealing and replacing” these regulations  —   most of which were passed as part of the   Act in 2010.    For the past six years, these reforms have provided key protections to consumers and stability to the banking system by protecting consumers. They’ve made banks more resilient and created stability in the capital markets.  Expect Republicans, as in the case of the health care bill, to attack the regulations by way of the budget: specifically, through the “budget reconciliation” process that eliminates the threat of a Democratic filibuster. Contrary to many headlines, the executive orders President Donald Trump has released so far related to banking regulations do little more than call for reviews. Reviews are the sort of thing a   administration would normally have quietly done during the transition. True, Trump can do damage to financial reform when he appoints regulators hostile to enforcing the law. But undoing the regulations won’t be as simple as flipping a switch, or swapping out one set of political appointees for another. There would have been no point in passing something like   if a Republican president could overturn it by fiat.    It is unlikely, also, that Congress will overturn   with a big bill. The Senate is the crucial threshold, and the legislation Republicans have floated is so aggressive it’s unlikely it can get 60 votes. The CHOICE Act that has been proposed by Republicans in the House would repeal or dismantle virtually every part of   from the Volcker Rule (which prevents commercial banks from making certain kinds of speculative trades) to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to the ability to prevent a collapsing financial firm from bringing down the broader economy.     But the CHOICE Act goes still further, splitting the Federal Reserve in half and preventing it from coordinating financial regulations and monetary policy, something that will make bubbles more likely  —   and more dangerous to the economy. It would reduce the deference given to regulatory agencies, making regulations harder to pass, and harder to interpret. Republicans did not seek any Democrat input on the bill, and as such it’s unlikely to gain the support it needs to overcome a filibuster. Bloomberg’s Matt Levine called the bill “a kitchen sink of grievances. ” Yet there’s a way around the filibuster  —   one that will be familiar to those who have closely followed the health care debate. For years, conservatives in Congress have been eyeing the pieces of   that can be repealed through budget reconciliation, a process that only requires a simple majority vote in the Senate (if the changes follow a complicated set of rules related to spending). This poses the biggest danger to financial reform in the next year.    Where financial regulations are concerned, Republicans’ top targets may surprise you. Many knowledgeable observers, such as Ben Bernanke, point to the ability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to take over and   a financial firm on the eve of collapse  —   an ability created by    —   as a signal achievement of financial reform. Such powers would have prevented Lehman Brothers from going into bankruptcy in an uncontrolled manner, as it did in 2008, and would have thereby taken significant stress off the financial system. Yet these powers are in the crosshairs.  Many also argue that the risks of lending and borrowing among investment banks in the capital markets  —     “shadow banking”  —   carry the potential to produce panics, runs, and other crises. Regulators have made progress in limiting such risks. Yet Republicans want to bring this kind of oversight to a halt.  Republicans love to hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The biggest target of all, however, is likely to be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to ensure that consumers have a dedicated financial regulator on their side. In its short life, the CFPB has been a remarkable success. It was essential in extracting a $100 million settlement from Wells Fargo for creating fake accounts for its customers that they did not want, then charging them fees for those accounts. It has provided billions of dollars in relief through legal actions against companies that used deceptive practices to sell financial products.     Perhaps most importantly, the bureau has brought transparency and accountability to previously opaque markets like consumer credit reporting, making clear just how much putting that new computer on your credit card will cost you in the long run. It has clarified for consumers the fine print aggressively wielded by nonbank debt collectors, mortgage and student debt servicers, and   colleges. These are markets where consumers are often not in a position to rectify injustices themselves. Conservatives have argued, however, that the CFPB is unaccountable and     —   that it lacks any of the administrative checks that accompany other regulatory agencies. Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( ) chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has called it the “most powerful and least accountable” agency in American history. That’s the same exact wording used by Mitt Romney while running for President in in 2012. But this supposed unaccountability is a canard. The CFPB is structured exactly like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) another banking regulator  —   one that the CFPB is designed to complement and counterbalance. Like the Comptroller of the Currency, the CFPB has a single director, a dedicated funding stream, and a clear mission.  The similarity between the two regulatory agencies is no accident. (Indeed, the Senate Report on the   Act says the CFPB’s policies and “provisions are modeled on similar statutes governing the Office of the Comptroller. ”) In the   to the financial crisis, the OCC and other federal regulators put bank profitability over safeguards for consumers. The CFPB wields a similar level of powers but has a mandate to fight for consumers. It was unclear whether President Trump would fire CFPB Director Richard Cordray upon taking office. The legal case to do so was nonexistent, though many prominent Republicans encouraged him to. For now, Cordray has his job, which is set to naturally end in July of 2018, though the CFPB is still a target. We can expect Republicans to use reconciliation to dramatically reduce the budget, and by extension the effectiveness, of the CFPB. A move to keep “shadow banking” in the shadows The next target for Republicans will be the mechanism we have for dealing with risks posed by the overall financial sector. One of the lessons of the financial crisis is that it’s possible for the risks associated with traditional banking  —   panics, bank runs, and cascading failures of institutions  —   to be present in activities and institutions that aren’t traditional banks.     In the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ collapse, investors in money market mutual funds, for instance, began rapidly pulling their funds. Soon, money market funds with no known Lehman exposure were having panics; in one week, investors in such funds withdrew $349 billion. This was the beginning of an It’s a Wonderful Life style banking run, but one that was in the capital markets of Wall Street instead of your neighborhood bank. Rapid deregulation had led to a situation in which large commercial banks like Citigroup had investment banking subsidiaries within them that were poorly regulated relative to traditional banking.   has fought for a consistent and clear regulatory regime for this type of credit creation. Republicans, however, don’t share this goal: The American Enterprise Institute recently ran a headline flatly stating “Shadow banks are not a source of systemic risk. ” Republicans plan on instituting    regulation reflecting that assumption.  The way Republicans plan on achieving this dubious goal is by reducing the funding for the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) a council of regulators whose job is to monitor the financial system, while also slashing the budget of the newly created Office for Financial Research (OFR). The Financial Stability Oversight Council requires financial firms that pose an unusually high risk of collapse, panic, and uncertainty to the economy to follow tougher regulations  —   including straightforward regulations followed by regular commercial banks. Republicans will also weaken the FSOC by appointing people to the council who share the ideology that there are no special risks in this sector. This upcoming attack is unfortunate because, as Amias Gerety, former Treasury assistant secretary for Financial Institutions under President Obama, describes in a recent paper, there’s been significant progress in reducing systemic banking risks. Bets that were hidden off the balance sheet of major financial firms have been put back on the books, making them clearer to investors and forcing banks to fund themselves with enough capital to handle the attendant risks.  New capital requirements require firms to have enough liquid funds to survive a crisis and make required payments to other firms. The riskier money market funds have been reorganized so they now have a value that fluctuates, which reduces the incentives for investors to be the first out the door like they did after Lehman failed. (Before, investors tended to bolt when money market funds “broke the buck”  —   when the share of a fund purchased per dollar dipped below $1. The new system makes it clearer that such funds, which tend to have low risk and low returns, aren’t guarantees.) However, by going after the funding of the regulators designed to handle future risks in capital markets, progress could be stopped dead.    Some institutions are indeed “too big to fail. ” But that doesn’t fit GOP ideology. Republicans will also try to use budget reconciliation to kill the funding and emergency powers given to the FDIC to deal with a failing financial institution, should the Lehman Brothers scenario recur. One reason is that many influential Republicans think, once again, that there’s simply no systemic problem that needs fixing. When Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling introduced his CHOICE Act to roll back   he answered a question about the “too big to fail” issue by saying that letting big banks fail, as the government did in the case of Lehman, posed no problems: “Although it was painful, and somewhat chaotic, in many respects, those in the bankruptcy arena would tell you, the Lehman bankruptcy, to some extent, worked as it should have worked. ” But there are good reasons why we shouldn’t simply let financial institutions like Lehman Brothers go bankrupt, especially during a crisis. Bankruptcy is slow while a financial crisis is quick. Bankruptcy isn’t designed to stop financial runs or keep operations running, and it is certainly not designed to quickly coordinate across the vast complexity of financial firms that exist in dozens of countries.  Access to a secure line of funding is necessary to keep crucial banking functions running  —   and that can be difficult to secure during a bankruptcy, especially if the financial markets are chaotic. A random bankruptcy judge won’t have any experience with the financial firm in advance. What’s more, both the bankruptcy judge and Congress will face huge political pressure to resort to bailouts to prevent a crisis. To handle this,   provides the FDIC with a special power to take over and gradually shutter financial firms in case of emergencies.  It’s called Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) which oversees what Barney Frank calls “death panels for banks. ” Such liquidations are designed to function in some ways like bankruptcies, but they’re executed by regulators, who will have great familiarity with the industry and the firm. They can be done on the eve of a failure, which prevents managers from gambling to try to fix themselves  —   creating new problems that put the financial system at risk.  The FDIC can adjudicate claims quickly under this receivership, including putting a hold on derivatives and other complicated financial instruments. It can create a bridge company that allows for the transfer important entities to a new company. By targeting the parent company of a financial firm’s structure and forcing it to prepare for failure in advance, it can handle international scale and complex scope of financial institutions in a way bankruptcy cannot.     The liquidation authority has a dedicated funding stream that allows the FDIC to borrow against the failing firm’s assets in a time of crisis. Though taxpayer money is always recovered first by statute, the CBO scored this power as having a budgetary cost. This score is controversial because CBO assumed money would be lent within the   period but not recovered until afterward. Thus, under the complex reconciliation rules, Republicans can change and perhaps remove this power.   can be weakened through neglect, and the regulators President Trump puts into place are certainly likely to try that strategy. But the main danger is funding. Paul Ryan’s goal in the next two years is to recreate the federal government using a narrow majority and Senate budget rules to dodge the filibuster. This approach is dangerous when it comes to financial reform, because instead of creating a system that works for the overall economy, the proposals may well amount to a    of whatever fits this procedural trick.  Rapid change is the strength of this approach, but it would be rapid change in a direction that hurts consumers  —   and it makes a repeat of the 2007 to 2008 financial meltdown more likely.

            "Message: Britain’s Prince Harry to start Australian army stint  (CNN) As his military career winds down, Britain’s Prince Harry is going to be spending some time down under. The    prince is due to arrive Monday in Australia for a   stint with the armed forces there. Harry ”will work and live alongside colleagues in the Australian Army in a number of regiments in Sydney, Darwin and Perth,” the Australian Defence Forces said Thursday. He has already spent time with Australian troops on a number of occasions during his   military career, a spokesman said. ”Prince Harry has trained and served alongside Australian armed forces on operational tours to Afghanistan he has met them during the Invictus Games and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,” the spokesman said. Leaving the military in June, The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Harry is known in the British Army as ”Captain Harry Wales,” from his official title and name, His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales.  He began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Last month, he announced that he would be leaving the armed forces in June, describing the decision as ”really tough.” Australian military officials say the prince’s program with them will be ”challenging.” It will involve training in urban settings and patrolling the Australian bush, as well as aviation activities and fire exercises. He’ll also participate in regular activities like physical training and pack marches, the Australian military said. Support for the wounded, Harry will also spend time meeting wounded, injured and ill service members in Australia. ”Wounded warriors” are a special interest for Prince Harry. He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty. Before he reports for duty Monday, the prince will lay a wreath at the war memorial in the Australian capital, Canberra. During his attachment with the Australian military, Harry will accompany Charles on a trip to Turkey at the end of April for commemorations on the anniversary of the World War I Battle of Gallipoli.\n",

            "Message: Intelligence Chiefs ’Stand More Resolutely’ Behind Finding Of Russia Election Hacking Updated at 2:15 p. m. ET, Intelligence agency leaders repeated their determination Thursday that only ”the senior most officials” in Russia could have authorized recent hacks into Democratic National Committee and Clinton officials’ emails during the presidential election. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper affirmed an Oct. 7 joint statement from 17 intelligence agencies that the Russian government directed the election interference  —   and went further. ”We stand more resolutely on that statement,” Clapper said during a Senate Armed Services hearing with the intelligence chiefs into the politically charged issue. Clapper noted that the intelligence officials would not dive into many more details at this hearing, deferring to a broader, unclassified report on the election interference to be released next week. Committee Chairman John McCain,  . said there is no national security interest ”more vital to the U. S. than the ability to hold free and fair elections without foreign interference,” and that ”every American should be alarmed by Russia’s attacks on our nation.” ”We will ascribe” a motive for the Russian cyberattack in the upcoming report, Clapper said. He wouldn’t say Thursday what it is, but it has been widely reported that the intelligence agencies agree that Russia was trying to get Donald Trump elected. Clapper also said he will ”push the envelope” to make much of that report unclassified without jeopardizing sources or   details. ”The public should know as much about this as possible,” Clapper said. In addition to Clapper, testifying before the committee were Defense Undersecretary Marcel Lettre and Adm. Michael Rogers, commander of the U. S. Cyber Command of the National Security Agency. All three will be leaving their positions at the end of the Obama administration. One of the first questions from McCain was about the involvement of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks published emails  —   from the account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta  —   that the intelligence community says were hacked by the Russians. Assange has denied the Russian government gave WikiLeaks the emails. McCain asked Clapper if Assange had any credibility. ”Not in my view,” Clapper said, adding that Assange ”has put people at risk” with revelations about U. S. intelligence gathering. ”I don’t think those of us in the intelligence community have a whole lot of respect for him,” Clapper said.   Trump, however, has openly questioned whether Russia was involved in the hacking, pointed to errors the intelligence community made over the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and has appeared to back Assange in tweets. Clapper also said there is a difference ”between skepticism and disparagement” of the intelligence community. Trump has taken to Twitter, referring to ”Intelligence” and its officials in quotations. Clapper also testified that there is no evidence the Russian hacking changed vote tallies ”or anything of that sort.” He did say, however, there is no way of gauging the impact of Russia’s actions ”on choices the electorate made.” McCain asked Clapper if the Russian   constituted ”an act of war.” Clapper responded that constitutes ”a very heavy policy call,” which, he said, ”I don’t think the intelligence communities should make.” But he did say what was done carried ”great gravity.” Clapper added that Russia deployed more than just cyberattacks in its effort to disrupt the election, calling it a multifaceted campaign. ”The hacking was only one part of it,” he said. ”It also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news,” which he said was still going on. There was a fair amount of talk about rocks and glass houses, with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina calling the Obama administration’s response to the hacking, a set of limited economic sanctions, just ”a pebble.” ”When it comes to interfering with our election,” Graham said, ”we better be ready to throw rocks.” Sen. Thom Tillis,  . C. noted the U. S. has also attempted to interfere in other nations’ elections. ”We live in a big glass house,” Tillis said, ”and there are a lot of rocks to throw.”\n",

            "Message: Geraldo vouches for US general accused of plotting failed Turkish coup Yeni Safak, a Turkish tabloid known as friendly to the increasingly authoritarian regime in Ankara, hit newsstands Monday with a   blaring in Turkish “This man led the coup,” alongside a picture of U. S. Army Gen. J. F. Campbell. It was news to Campbell, who retired in May after a distinguished,   career that saw him most recently serve in both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Campbell served as commander of the NATO International Security Assistance Force from August 2014 to earlier this year. ”I haven’t traveled outside the U. S. since I came back from Afghanistan in March,” Campbell told FoxNews. com. ”I have no idea why they picked me for this headline. ”In fact, on the day of the coup I think I was in New York City  with Geraldo having a beer,” he added. The newsman corroborated the general’s claim. @ahmetsyayla After Monday morning, there is a CONSIDERABLE risk against the Americans, US Embassy and consulates in Turkey. I advise caution, ”I absolutely vouch for General Campbell,” Rivera said. ”The only thing we were overthrowing were a series of Stella Artois [beers].” As bizarre as the claim may be, some experts said the accusation ratchets up tensions with the U. S. in a way that could put Americans at risk. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has used the coup to justify a massive crackdown on opposition, is playing a dangerous game by pointing the finger at the U. S. “This is absolutely nuts,” said Fox News contributor and former Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters. “Erdogan’s cynical, though, and often plays the nationalist card. There’s no easier target than the Americans. ” The State Department referred requests for comment to Campbell, who said no one from the U. S. government has contacted him about the matter. “This   rhetoric reminds [me of] the ’79 Iranian revolution and what happened afterward. It is a very dangerous approach,” Ahmet Yayla, former chief of   for the Turkish National Police and a member of the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism, tweeted Monday. Yayla said the irresponsible charge is part of Turkey’s   from the West in the wake of the coup attempt. Erdogan has declared a   state of emergency after the failed coup and detained as many as 50, 000 academics, judges, soldiers and civil servants. He has seized control of thousands of public and private institutions, rooting out all of those he suspects of sympathizing with his   U. S.  cleric Fethullah Gulen. The U. S. response to the crackdown has been muted, and Secretary of State John Kerry is considering Turkey’s demand that Gulen, who lives in a compound in the Pocono mountains of Pennsylvania, be turned over. NATO and European leaders have expressed alarm at the breadth and rapidity of the crackdown, which critics fear is  an effort by Erdogan, to cement his hold on power and move the constitutionally secular nation toward an Islamist government. Still, rumors and accusations of U. S. involvement in the coup attempt have been circulating for more than a week. Several of the fighter planes involved in bombing government facilities took off from the jointly operated Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, from which the U. S. conducts air strikes against the Islamic State. President Obama told Erdogan in a telephone conversation last week that reports the U. S. was involved in the coup were “unequivocally false. ” Obama also said he hoped “there is not an overreaction that could, in some fashion, lead to curtailment of civil liberties,” according to a spokesman. Gulen, once a political ally of Erdogan, has a large following embedded throughout Turkish society and Erdogan believes he played a leading role in the coup. Gulen runs a global network of Islamist schools and charities. The United States says it will only extradite Gulen to Turkey if it receives strong evidence that he was involved in the coup. Campbell said he has never met Gulen. \n",

            "Message: Running the government is like conducting an orchestra, not having a sword fight      President Trump signing an executive order temporarily or indefinitely freezing immigration from seven broken countries should be no more than a 4 on the “ ” scale of 1 to 10. To remind, the executive order suspends entry into the United States for refugees from any country for 120 days; suspends refugees from Syria indefinitely; and bars visitors from the seven countries President Obama restricted from participating in the Visa Waiver Program for 90 days. So why has the reaction to this order become an 8? Restricting immigration from select countries on sudden notice is fair game for criticism. But it should not have been hard to anticipate the criticism and get in front of most of it. It is usually standard operating procedure at the White House to be prepared with a rollout plan for any significant presidential announcements, including fact sheets, prepared surrogates and allies, a rapid response plan, etc. Most people working at the White House already know all this and more. So why weren’t they ready? Similarly, Trump wanting to include his senior strategist in National Security Council meetings should be a 1 on the    scale. In this news cycle, it has risen to about a 5. Why? Well, two reasons. First, this order slightly changed the wording of some previous orders, suggesting there was something different about the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and director of national intelligence’s participation in NSC meetings. Second, some want to argue that political types should be excluded from NSC meetings, in an effort to head off potential criticism that national security decisions are made with politics in mind. As if to reinforce the idea that politics should be banned from the situation room, it has even been reported that Karl Rove was specifically excluded from President George W. Bush’s NSC meetings. Well, how did that work out? Arguably some of the worst decisions of the Bush era were made in NSC meetings. Right? Maybe Rove can’t say so, but maybe if he had been in the room, things would be different today. Anyway, I am told by a senior NSC official that a lot of NSC meetings are tedious, laborious affairs that are not always worth the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence’s time. Why didn’t the White House just say that? I’m always   myself when it comes to analyzing Trump: Does the White House see some value in the stark, unchoreographed nature of these announcements? The Trump team must recognize the headwinds they are facing. There is a bias to find fault and there always will be. It’s natural. Rather than just complain about it, they should anticipate what will be said against this, that or the other action and think three or four moves down the board. This may take a little more time and it may include more people, but they would avoid ultimately having to waste time on the defensive, doing damage control, when they could be doing something else. So what are the lessons learned from all the unintended and unanticipated consequences of Trump’s executive orders so far? A presidential election campaign is kind of like a sword fight. You dual with one opponent while foreign objects are thrown at the combatants and the media howls around you. Running an administration is like conducting a symphony. If the conductor shows up to the rostrum with only his or her   skills, armed with a weapon instead of a baton, and starts swinging the sword and shouting, the music isn’t going to be very pretty. That’s even more true if all the seats in the orchestra are not yet filled. As president, you always have the option to be patient. Team Trump should keep this in mind as they plot their next moves.\n",

            "Message: In Massachusetts, Coastal Residents Consider How To Adapt To Climate Change Living by the ocean might sound nice, but in the era of climate change, it’s a risky proposition. As sea levels rise, coastal residents are faced with tough choices: try to fortify their homes, move to higher ground or just pull up roots and leave. Homeowners in Nahant, Mass. are grappling with these wrenching questions. The community lies on a rocky crescent moon of land in the Atlantic Ocean just north of Boston. For its entire history, it has been at the mercy of the ocean. To get to the town back in the 1800s, you would cross a beautiful beach at low tide that connected it to the mainland. At high tide, you had to take a boat. These days, there’s a   road built on that beach, and it sits just a few feet above the water. Climate scientists predict that devastation of these areas from storms will become more common. Higher seas mean even a less powerful storm could push the tides up over Nahant’s seawalls. That is a problem Sam Merrill spends his days grappling with. He works with a firm that helps communities protect themselves from storms. ”The unfortunate thing is what we’re really facing in so many of these coastal areas is what you can rightly call an extinction threat  —   the extinction of a community,” Merrill says. ”We don’t know how to deal with extinction.

            "Message: This could be the start to a whole new world of chicken      Animal activists have shuddered for years at how supermarket chickens meet their end. Across the industry, they are hung upside down, often breaking their bones, bruising their legs and causing hemorrhages. Workers then cut their throats to kill them, before they’re plunked in boiling water. Now, America’s   chicken producer is introducing changes that animal rights groups are championing as a major step forward in animal welfare. Perdue, which processes nearly 700 million chickens every year at nearly 3, 000 farms, announced Monday that it will begin killing chickens using carbon dioxide or argon gas, so they can avoid being hung upside down. With an estimated revenue of $6 billion, according to IBISWorld, they are the first major company to announce that it will use this procedure, which is called   stunning. The new guidelines also said Perdue will expose chickens to more natural light, boost their activity levels and reduce the expectations for how fast chickens must grow. Today, chickens are bred to be so large and produce so much meat that their weight can crush their limbs and immobilize them, said Leah Garces, U. S. director for Compassion in World Farming.     Compassion in World Farming, Mercy for Animals and the Humane Society of the United States worked alongside Perdue for the initiative, culling ideas from smaller organic companies that Perdue had acquired. They follow a rise in consumer demand for better slaughterhouse practices. ”We are seeing from our consumers more questions that are being raised about where their food comes from,” Perdue spokeswoman Julie DeYoung said. Brett Hundley, agribusiness analyst for BB&T Capital Markets, said the initiative could increase costs by 5 to 15 percent, but it appeals to consumers who are increasingly worried about animal welfare. ”A lot of people have been focused on what this could add to your cost profile,” Hundley said. ”But at the same time, it allows you, at the retail level, to market some of your packaging with the humanely raised assertion. A move like this that goes above and beyond and caters to what consumers care about today  —   it ideally allows both the companies and customers to differentiate and charge higher prices for their product.” Hundley said Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride and other major poultry companies will ”certainly” look into some of Perdue’s new intiatives, but it may be years until they adopt them. ”They truly care about   social issues, but they also care about producing chickens at the lowest cost for consumers.” Ron Kean, poultry production and management specialist at the University of Wisconsin, also foresees the issue of increased costs. ”I think that it will add costs and be less efficient, so they will have to market that claim for a niche market.” Perdue will probably be more appealing to a number of restaurants, retailers and individual consumers, Hundley said. KFC Canada said it will source exclusively birds killed by   stunning by the end of the year, and Wendy’s, Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Whole Foods Market, Bon Appetit Management and other major restaurants source, though not exclusively, those birds. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has advocated for the practice since 2002.    Keeping up with the demand for eggs can be stressful, but hens at Woodcock Farm in Derbyshire are reportedly relaxed, happy thanks to lighting installations that are specifically designed for chickens’ needs. (Reuters)   This year, Whole Foods announced it would shift to exclusively selling   chickens by 2024. For a leading   company, it’s the ”first real effort” to improve chickens’ lives, Hundley said. U. S. consumers today care ”a lot more about   issues than they did 10 or 15 years ago,” he said. It would not be the first time Perdue incited   change. Perdue was the biggest company to begin limiting antibiotics in 2002. It ceased growth antibiotics in 2007 and then totally eliminated them from their hatcheries by 2014. ”It’s safe to assume that the rest of the market chases” Perdue, Garces said. The company is ”leading the market in innovative problem solving.” Last year, Tyson Foods, which is the largest   company in the United States, said it would eliminate human antibiotics. Pilgrim’s Pride, which trails Tyson in chicken production, announced that it would cut back on antibiotics the same month as Tyson. Still, it will take time for   chickens killed by   stunning and   coops to be the industry norm. The poultry industry was sluggish in rolling back on antibiotics. The National Chicken Council, a poultry trade group, said as late as 2007 that antibiotics were not proven to be harmful to humans. It did not support Food and Drug Administration bans on antibiotics in 2012, but last year the group said it approved phasing out human antibiotics in chickens. Eliminating antibiotics makes chicken production pricier, but it also reduces health risk for the people who eat it. Although it’s legal in the United States, administering certain antibiotics on otherwise healthy animals is banned in the European Union, Canada and other countries. In response to whether they will implement policies to limit   chickens and traditional slaughtering methods, Tyson spokesman Worth Sparkman said the company has ongoing efforts to address animal   such as   audits. ”We work hard to be better in everything we do, including animal   and we’re making progress,” Sparkman wrote in an  . Tom Super, senior vice president of communications for the National Chicken Council, said   stunning was no more effective at humanely rendering chickens unconscious than the traditional method of   electrical stunning. Kean, the University of Wisconsin specialist, said that   stunning is easier on workers, but it is only negligibly nicer to chickens. ”Mostly, it sounds nicer.” But animal rights activists and conscious poultry companies think that it’s more than that. ”Birds don’t like being hung upside down,” Temple Grandin, a professor of animal science at Colorado State University, said in 2010 to the New York Times. “They get really stressed out by that. ” The policy is not yet flawless, Garces, of Compassion in World Farming, said. She said Perdue should put a timeline on its actions. For instance, it has pledged only to implement   stunning at two facilities so far, ”followed by gradual implementation at all our harvest facilities,” according to a press release. Sunlight will be in only a fraction of slaughterhouses. ”We’re calling this a good first step.”\n",

Horizontal photos with a bit of the plane visible —  a wing, the edge of a window —  are ideal. Terms and Conditions here.) Remaining states needed: CT, GA, MS, NM, ND, RI, VT, and WV. Our list of power plants continues to grow: a nuclear one over Michigan, a bunch of wind turbines over Colorado, some solar panels with crop circles in Arizona, a pair of   plants in Iowa   …     and now another nuclear one, this time on the California coast (followed by a bonus AbA photo from a new state —  Maine! ): Here’s the Pacific Gas  Electric nuclear reactor at Diablo Canyon, near Avila Beach, California. The picture was taken from the front seat of a Pitts Special biplane. The Diablo Canyon plant has churned out energy for the state of California for over 30 years but may finally succumb to requests for its closure from environment groups. Not if local Ellie Ripley can help it. From her letter to the editor of The San Luis Obispo Tribune: For 40 years, the   groups have been spouting off about how unsafe, poorly designed and outdated Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant is. Where are their credentials? Have they had any training, any experience in nuclear? Clearly they have not. They make their claims without any   facts. Diablo Canyon has been producing power for more than 30 years that has proven safe, clean, affordable and reliable. Shutting down Diablo Canyon would be trading 2, 250 megawatts of clean, nonpolluting energy to substitute it with fossil fuel which will be needed to back up intermittent renewable energy. Where is the sense in that? Another Tribune reader looks at the cost factor: [R]eplacing Diablo Canyon requires 14   solar farms. Solar farms like the Topaz facility take three years to build and cost about $2. 4 billion each. Building two a year it would take   years, 133 square miles of land and cost $33. 6 billion. Guess who pays the $33. 6 billion! Circling back to wind turbines, here’s an AbA submission from a reader flying above “Vinal Haven Island, Maine, on the way to and back from Portland”: With Maine now checked off the list of states we’ve covered in America by Air, only eight remain: Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia. Do you happen to have a good photo above one of those states? We’d love to post it: hello@theatlantic. com. Graham Hankey, a reader who previously paraglided over Idaho, sends a lovely shot of Mt. Hood, looking so close you could step out onto the summit —  which in fact he did: I fly into Portland frequently, and Hood is always impressive when the weather is clear. The mountain is a sentinel watching over the Columbia River Valley. This day in July 2016 was very cloudy, and I expected no views. But the undercast cracked just enough to reveal the upper slopes and summit of the   mountain. It was a good omen to see the mountain, as I planned to climb it a week later. My climb was successful I enjoyed splendid visibility and reached the summit at 6:15 a. m. after a   slog up the   climbing route, accessing the summit ridge via the Old Chute. Climbers try to get up and down before the sun warms the ice too much and produces ice and rock falls. Once on top, I was just a little lower than my Jet Blue photography platform of a week earlier.   I get very homesick for Oregon mountains, cloudy surroundings and all. When I was growing up in Portland, no summer was ever complete without a road trip out to Hood, and no road trip was ever complete without at least a few promises from my dad that the heavy layer of clouds on the horizon would “burn off” by the time we got there. He was usually right, luckily. Driving out of the Willamette Valley, the clouds would part to reveal a brilliant blue sky and even more mountains —  like the one in Graham’s second photo, looking south from the summit of Mt. Hood toward Mt. Jefferson. And here’s another shot from Graham looking north into Washington state, displaying the three distant peaks of St. Helens, Rainier, and Adams (from left to right): A reader sends a shot above Fiesta Texas, the Six Flags amusement park in San Antonio (and one that would drive the bigoted Eric Cartman crazy): From the air you can see the giant   wave pool and the massive parking lot. The photo was taken by me, John Matthews, from about 3500 feet MSL [mean sea level] from a friend’s Mooney [a type of   plane]. I spent part of my early childhood in Stuttgart, Germany, where my mom was stationed with the U. S. Army, and some of my fondest memories were of the waterparks big in that area. The waterslides were much faster and more fun than the ones I’d seen in the States, and for the first time I experienced what a massive wave pool was like. A cursory history of wave pools suggests that my first encounter with one in Germany wasn’t a coincidence: Wave pools go as far back as the 19th Century, as famous fantasy castle builder Ludwig II of Bavaria electrified a lake to create breaking waves. The first [swimmable] wave pool was designed and built in 1927 [1] in Budapest, Hungary, and appeared in a    documentary about the city in 1938, as one of the main tourist attractions. [2] Palisades Amusement Park [in NJ] had a   wave pool during the 1940s. This was a huge pool whose waves were generated by a waterfall at one end. The pool in Point Mallard Park [in Decatur, AL] was developed in the early 1970s after Mayor Gilmer Blackburn saw enclosed “ ” swimming pools in Germany and thought one could be a tourist attraction in the U. S. There’s also a fantastic video on YouTube purportedly shot in 1929 showing a wave pool in Munich (“This is the new kind of swimming bath that is becoming the rage of Germany,” the opening card reads): As far as   superlatives, Siam Park City Water Park in Thailand is home to the world’s largest wave pool (video here) and the similarly named Siam Park (Tenerife) in Spain produces the largest waves —  nearly ten feet tall (video here). We’ve got a great little tangent going within America by Air of photos above power plants —  first a nuclear one over Michigan, then a   plant over Colorado, then a   plant in Arizona. The reader who sent the latter one, Adam Feiges, delivers again: You requested a   power plant and here you get two for the price of one: the South and North units of the George Neal Power Complex located in rural Woodbury County in western Iowa. These generating stations power a considerable portion of the agricultural economy in the heart of the Corn Belt, and they’ve survived flooding, explosions, tornados, and consent decrees. In the foreground of the shot is Browns Lake, an   lake marking a vestigial course of the Missouri River that today flows in a   channel barely visible on the far side of the two power plants. The influence of human activity on the landscape represented in this photo is all encompassing: the course of a major river, the massive piles of Wyoming coal, the forest cover on the Nebraska hills in the background, the massive industrial complexes, and the farm fields that cover most of the ground are all anthropocentric artifacts. Only the   lake and the wetlands on the interior of the loop are remnants of the natural world, and even they are heavily influenced by the power plants since they are part of the water management process that cools the outflow from the facilities. What’s next in this   of power plants —  a hydroelectric dam perhaps? Drop us a note if you have any good ones to share: hello@theatlantic. com. Ray Wasilewski of Clive, Iowa, sends a perfectly framed photo that his wife recently took from the passenger seat of the plane he was flying: In August, Iowa begins to change. We still have the beautiful green from the crops that thrive in our soil, while colors are beginning to change as we approach harvest. In this picture taken near Mason City, Iowa, you can see much of what it means to live in America’s heartland. The pride of the people who care for the land jumps out at you. Large farm equipment stands at the ready, and the classic car near the Quonset hut barn makes it easy to believe you are viewing a scene from the past. Seeing this perspective, both the history and the new growth, is a special feeling. The farm has an aviation connection: In 2000, the Mason City Airport was planning an expansion, and the location of this farm —  not far off the end of one of the runways (you can see one runway at the   of the photo) —  meant it would need to go. But people fought back, and 16 years later the farm is still there. As a pilot, I’m a big supporter of airports, but I’m happy to have this view when landing at that great airport. With their fantastic photo, Ray and Cindy also cross Iowa off our list of 50 states to cover for America by Air. We’re now down to single digits —  CT, GA, ME, MS, NM, ND, RI, VT, WV —  so if you have a great aerial view from one of those states, please send our way. I wrote a post yesterday about the wildfire raging along California’s Big Sur coast that has surpassed the $200   to combat —  and it’s only   contained. A reader in California, Christopher Baker, saw the fire when it started two months ago. He writes: I saw your article and thought you’d find interesting the enclosed photo I took out the window of a Southwest flight on the evening of July 23 flying north from San Diego to San Francisco. It was extremely clear and I saw what I think is the first day of the fire out the window. The fire was very bright but still somewhat small, and I think I could see backfires started by the firefighters. It’s a remarkable sight because during my 50 years in California I’ve seen many brushfires from the air but never was the view this clear normally they are obscured by the smoke. At its peak last month, more than 5, 600 firefighters were working to put out the blaze. It’s destroyed 57 homes and threatens another 400. And all of this because someone left a small campfire burning while visiting Garrapata State Park. Here’s another beauty from Jimmy Rollison, one of the top contributors to this series (with views over the Continental Divide, Monument Valley and Lake Powell, Dinosaur National Monument, and the rolling hills of northern California): How to start a Monday: Southbound at 10, 500’ looking west, en route home from Hood River, Oregon, from a large antique airplane   once a year. As the song says: “Nothing but blue skies do I see. ” The lake —  the deepest one in the U. S. —  formed around 7, 700 years ago when Mt. Mazama collapsed after a massive volcanic eruption, one that was 42 times greater than Mount St. Helens in 1980. The resulting caldera is what you see above (and in this Orbital View). Rain and snowfall fills the caldera, and no rivers flow into or out of Crater Lake, so it takes about 250 years for the total amount of water to cycle out. A   road, Rim Drive, wraps around the lake, and my first long bike ride happened to be around it, in the summer of 2010. The gorgeous locale and sunny weather of that day was only dampened by the timing of the ride —  just a month after my brother got into a terrible bike accident in Portland that resulted in several broken teeth and nearly a broken neck. His   face loomed in my head as I raced down Rim Drive to catch up with the more experienced cyclists. Every tiny rock on the road felt like a speed bump, and my clenched hands were sorer than my legs by the end of the ride. But my brother is braver than I am he was back to his long bike commutes in no time. We’re down to the final stretch of U. S. states in this series, so if you happen to have an aerial view above CT, GA, IA, ME, MS, NM, ND, RI, VT, or WV, please send it our way. I just came off a   vacation that included six days at Burning Man —  the       festival held every year in the desolate Black Rock Desert of northern Nevada. (This satirical video of a guy coming back from BM has a lot of truth to it, and this tumblr of Burner mockery is also pretty brilliant.) The 30th Burn attracted more than 70, 000 people to this     city: But I could barely see Black Rock City myself during the short flight from Reno due to one of the sudden dust storms that are all too frequent in that desert. (I might have missed the dusty deluge if I hadn’t been delayed at the Reno airport for several hours because President Obama was in nearby Tahoe for an environmental summit and Air Force One was on the tarmac freezing flights   …     Thanks, Obama!) So instead of getting an aerial photo similar to the one above, all I got was this   scene: After landing in the dust storm, I struggled to keep up with my friend heading to our camp by bicycle with an   pack on my back and many beers in my belly (like I said, it was a long wait in Reno). Not being able to see 20 feet in front of me made for a surreal, somewhat perilous ride my friend stopped so abruptly that I bumped right into him. To get an   idea of how opaque it gets out there, here’s a photo taken on the last day by a friend I had just met —  a talented young photographer and visual artist from Vancouver —  thus bookending my trip in dust storms. You can’t see the people behind us, but they’re there: If you happened to capture any good photos of Black Rock City this year (I personally took a vacation from my iPhone and didn’t bring my SLR due to dust danger) please send our way: hello@theatlantic. com. Update from reader Doug McDougall, who sends a   view of a dust storm descending over the playa in Black Rock Desert: We usually prefer images that include a piece of the plane or other aircraft, but reader Graham —  hovering here over Ketchum, Idaho —  included his own feet: I was on a hiking and biking vacation in Ketchum, Idaho, and decided to try paragliding (much to my wife’s chagrin) after watching several gliders launch from the summit of Mt. Baldy, the major ski mountain in the valley. I contacted Fly Sun Valley, the only licensed paragliding outfit in the area, and made arrangements for a tandem flight the next evening before sunset. The flight was incredible. We sailed for 25 minutes, launching from Baldy’s summit and heading west while we gained another 1, 000 feet of altitude, and then turned and came back across the mountain at 10, 000 feet and slowly began descending into Sun Valley, making a series of lazy circles before landing in a large field just outside of Ketchum. I was able to take many pictures on my iPhone (permissible, but I was warned that several phones had been dropped, never to be seen again) and even shoot a video. The experience was wonderful —  a great perspective to see a beautiful part of America. Beautiful, indeed. Here’s Graham’s shot looking into the Sawtooth Wilderness, with the resort town of Sun Valley in the foreground: He adds: Ketchum and Sun Valley seemed to weather the financial crisis just fine, and the folks that manage and plan the community should be applauded for avoiding   solutions to economic downturns. They’ve invested for the   sacrificed some quick   to preserve the scenic nature of the valley (which will yield a   payoff I think   …     ) and are turning the resort into a legitimate   destination (mountain biking will be as big as skiing someday soon). In this they are following the lead of other major resorts, such as British Columbia’s Whistler. Dare I say that it sounds like business is really   …     taking off? If you’ve got an aerial snapshot to share, particularly one above CT, GA, IA, ME, MS, NM, ND, RI, VT, or WV, please send it along. Genuine thunderstorms, of the type that form a long line when a cold front is moving across the country into warmer, wetter air, or that pop up as isolated cloudbursts on summer afternoons, are weather perils that even big, powerful airliners must avoid. When you’re flying in thunderstormy conditions, you hear airline pilots asking controllers for   around the storms. “New York Center, United 1234, we’ll need to go 30 degrees left to avoid these buildups. ” The updrafts and downdrafts of wind around a thunderstorm “cell” can be so powerful that small aircraft are supposed to fly at least 20 miles away from the storm’s edge to avoid being tossed up and down. But “ ” rain showers, those not from thunderstorms, are more benign. On a trip this past Wednesday from Eastport, Maine, all the way back to the Washington area in a little Cirrus, my wife Deb and I flew in rain for most of the journey. But the rain was falling from a flattish,   cloud layer far above us, and it spattered on the wings and windshield as we flew in clear skies at 4, 500 feet. (For the aviation crowd: this whole trip was VFR and free of turbulence and clouds at 6, 500, then 4, 500, then 3, 500 feet, KEPM to KGAI, with a fuel stop at KPSF.) And sometimes we passed localized rain showers, always keeping a respectful distance. Here is how the area just over the Lancaster airport, in the heart of the Amish country of Pennsylvania, looked at about 4 p. m. on Wednesday, from 10 miles to the east, outside the rain.  What looks like a cloud reaching all the way to the ground, off the plane’s wingtip, would have seemed to people in Lancaster to be a drenching downpour. The gray you see reaching from cloud to ground is rain.   From the ground, it’s hard to see or imagine weather other than what is affecting us at the moment. From a distance in the air you can see, godlike, the movement of different weather across the land. Reader Jim Ciszewski answers our call for photos from Indiana: Taken on a recent trip from GSO to MDW [Greensboro, North Carolina, to Chicago, Illinois] this photo shows the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal in northwest Indiana, including ArcelorMittal (originally Inland Steel) the Whiting BP (originally Amoco) refinery, etc. I grew up on the far South Side of Chicago, not far from here, in the ’70s and early ’80s, when the “rust belt” was beginning. Lots of rust color —  and conveyor belts in action —  to be seen via satellite here, where the canal empties into Lake Michigan near the plume of steam in the background of Jim’s photo: What’s going on down there? The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers has these statistics about what passes through the Indiana Harbor : Commodities are iron ore, limestone, coke, gypsum, steel, cement and concrete, petroleum products, and miscellaneous bulk products. . .. Bulk commodities that pass through the harbor . .. generate $332. M annually in direct revenue while supporting 1, 495 direct, indirect, and induced jobs that produce $263. M per year in direct income. Pretty impressive, Indiana. If you’ve got a photo to share —  particularly one from CT, GA, ID, IA, ME, MS, NM, ND, RI, VT, or WV —  let us know. Here’s the latest from Jimmy Rollison, one of our ace photographers for the series, who’s provided stunning views over Monument Valley, Dinosaur National Monument, and the Continental Divide. This colorful one was captured over Duncan Mills, California. “It’s west of Sacramento,” he writes, “looking at the coastal range that separates the Sacramento Valley from the Napa Valley in a 1939 airplane. ” Update from another reader, Frank: That “1939 airplane” is a Beech Model 17 “Staggerwing” biplane, and I think it is the most beautiful   propeller driven aircraft ever produced (although the Supermarine Spitfire is very closely competitive). The Staggerwing is, truly, Walter Beech’s masterpiece. Notice how the upper biplane wing is mounted aft of the lower, a rare feature called “negative wing stagger” that gives the airplane its unique appearance and grace. Next time you are in DC, wander by the National Air and Space Museum on the Mall and make your way to the Golden Age of Flight gallery. Therein, a yellow Model 17 is suspended for your examination and admiration. Thanks for the series the photos are great. So are the emails! Here’s the beauty that Frank mentions: \n",

            "Message: Aleppo and American decline  The fall of Aleppo just weeks before Barack Obama leaves office is a fitting stamp on his Middle East policy of retreat and withdrawal. The pitiable pictures from the devastated city showed the true cost of Obama’s abdication. For which he seems to have few regrets, however. In his    news conference, Obama defended U. S. inaction with his familiar false choice: It was either stand aside or order a massive   ground invasion.  This is a transparent fiction designed to stifle debate. At the beginning of the civil war, the popular uprising was ascendant. What kept a rough equilibrium was regime control of the skies. At that point, the United States, at little risk and cost, could have declared Syria a   zone, much as it did Iraqi Kurdistan for a dozen years after the Gulf War of 1991. The U. S. could easily have destroyed the regime’s planes and helicopters on the ground and so cratered its airfields as to make them unusable. That would have altered the strategic equation for the rest of the war.  And would have deterred the Russians from injecting their own air force  —   they would have had to challenge ours for air superiority. Facing no U. S. deterrent, Russia stepped in and decisively altered the balance, pounding the rebels in Aleppo to oblivion. The Russians were particularly adept at hitting hospitals and other civilian targets, leaving the rebels with the choice between annihilation and surrender. They surrendered. Obama has never appreciated that the role of a superpower in a local conflict is not necessarily to intervene on the ground, but to deter a rival global power from stepping in and altering the course of the war. That’s what we did during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when Moscow threatened to send troops to support Egypt and President Nixon countered by raising America’s nuclear alert status to Defcon 3. Russia stood down.  Less dramatically but just as effectively, American threats of retaliation are what kept West Germany, South Korea and Taiwan free and independent through half a century of Cold War. It’s called deterrence. Yet Obama never had the credibility to deter anything or anyone. In the end, the world’s greatest power was reduced to bitter speeches at the United Nations. “Are you truly incapable of shame?” thundered U. S. Ambassador Samantha Power at the butchers of Aleppo. As if we don’t know the answer. Indeed the shame is on us for terminal naivete, sending our secretary of state chasing the Russians to negotiate one humiliating pretend   after another. Even now, however, the Syria debate is not encouraging. The tone is anguished and emotional, portrayed exclusively in moral terms. Much less appreciated is the cold strategic cost. Assad was never a friend. But today he’s not even a free agent. He’s been effectively restored to his throne, but as the puppet of Iran and Russia. Syria is now a platform, a forward base, from which both these revisionist regimes can project power in the region.  Iran will use Syria to advance its drive to dominate the Arab Middle East. Russia will use its naval and air bases to bully the Sunni Arab states, and to shut out American influence. It’s already happening. The foreign and defense ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey convened in Moscow this week to begin settling the fate of Syria. Notice who wasn’t there. For the first time in four decades, the United States, the once dominant power in the region, is an irrelevance. With Aleppo gone and the rebels scattered, we have a long road ahead to rebuild the influence squandered over the past eight years.   Donald Trump is talking about creating safe zones. He should tread carefully. It does no good to try to do now what we should have done five years ago. Conditions are much worse. Russia and Iran rule. Maintaining the safety of safe zones will be expensive and dangerous. It will require extensive ground deployments, and it risks military confrontation with Russia. And why? Guilty conscience is not a good reason. Interventions that are purely humanitarian  —   from Somalia to Libya  —   tend to end badly. We may proclaim a “responsibility to protect,” but when no American interests are at stake, the engagement becomes impossible to sustain. At the first losses, we go home. In Aleppo, the damage is done, the city destroyed, the inhabitants ethnically cleansed. For us, there is no   option. If we are to regain the honor lost in Aleppo, it will have to be on a very different battlefield.

            "Message: The GOP stoops for scandal  The Republican yearning to pin a scandal on Hillary Clinton knows no bounds. Any scandal will do, real or imagined. She must somehow be  —   or appear to be  —   guilty of something . They tried Benghazi. Boy, did they try Benghazi. House Republicans even put together a special committee, which Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy praised for hurting Clinton’s chances of being elected president. “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?” he said in September. “But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. ”  To the GOP’s consternation, however, those numbers recovered nicely. According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, she leads Donald Trump by about 5 points; the most recent Washington   News survey showed her ahead by 12. Adding insult to injury, the Benghazi committee came up  . Rep. Trey Gowdy ( . C.) the panel’s chairman, released a final report last week that found no smoking gun. In fact, it didn’t even find smoke. The September 2012 attacks on U. S. diplomatic and intelligence facilities in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans should be blamed on the terrorists who committed the assault  —   not on the secretary of state. Even if she happens to be named Clinton. So if Benghazi isn’t the   scandal, what else might be? Trump keeps threatening to   the 1990s by dredging up Bill Clinton’s womanizing and even the suicide of Clinton friend and associate Vince Foster. That is a realm peopled mostly by conspiracy theorists wearing tinfoil hats; Trump can go there if he wants, but the rest of the country won’t follow.   House Republicans released their report on the attack on the 2012 U. S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi on June 28. Here are the 5 most serious accusations in the report. (Peter   Washington Post)   Let’s see, there’s the Clinton Foundation and the vast amount of money it has raised, including from foreign governments, potentates and moguls. The problem with this line of attack is that the foundation, by all accounts, does a lot of good around the world. And it generally operates in a way that Republicans should applaud, not simply doling out money but instead boosting the capacity of local governments and organizations to solve their own problems. What other grist for the scandal mill could there be? I’m being somewhat disingenuous, of course. There are Hillary Clinton’s emails.  As I’ve written, Clinton was wrong to decline a government email account when she was secretary of state and instead use a private account run from a server in her house. What was she thinking? I doubt it was “convenience,” as she still claims. I’ve believed all along that Clinton wanted control. I think she wanted to guarantee that no personal or foundation emails would ever become part of the public record and thus potentially subject to release. It is certainly true that the Clintons have legions of political enemies who would love to root through the family’s private affairs. This fact does not, however, make Clinton’s actions right. But were they illegal? And were they criminal? That’s what the FBI and Justice Department lawyers are trying to ascertain. From what is publicly known about the emails, I am unimpressed. The salient issue is whether she mishandled classified material. Clinton’s critics note that David Petraeus, a former CIA director and one of the most lauded military officers of his time, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was hit with a $100, 000 fine for that offense. But it seems to me that routing potentially sensitive emails through a private server is different from handing classified information to one’s mistress, which is what Petraeus did.

            "Message: ’Didn’t want her to run’: Podesta says top Clinton aide didn’t support presidential candidacy The exchange between Podesta and Center for American Progress head Neera Tanden on July 24, 2015, started when Tanden asked if Podesta knew “who told Hillary she could use a private email? Has that person been drawn and quartered?” “Don’t you think Cheryl?” Podesta answered. In a later reply to Tanden, Podesta added the kicker: “At least we now know why Cheryl didn’t want her to run. ” CLINTON AIDE CRIED FOUL ON OBAMA’S EMAIL DENIAL, That conversation wasn’t the first time Podesta and Tanden had speculated that Mills played a central role in the establishment of Clinton’s private email system. Just hours after The New York Times broke the Clinton email story on March 2, Podesta and Tanden exchanged emails about the nascent controversy that would dog Clinton throughout her run to the Democratic presidential nomination. See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → “This is a Cheryl special,” Tanden wrote in an email that would later be hacked from Podesta’s Gmail account and posted to WikiLeaks. “Know you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heal. Or kryptonite. She just can’t say no to this    . Why didn’t they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy. ” Podesta replied “Unbelievable” before Tanden answered her earlier question: “I guess I know the answer[.] they wanted to get away with it. ” Mills has been part of Team Clinton’s orbit for decades, since serving as an associate counsel to President Bill Clinton starting in 1993. Mills also was chief of staff for Hillary Clinton during her tenure at the State Department. Additionally, Mills, who now runs her own company, has been a trusted adviser to Hillary Clinton, with emails showing Mills’ influence extended from matters relating to The Clinton Foundation to numerous aspects of Clinton’s 2016 presidential run. The FBI interviewed Mills during its probe into Clinton’s private email server, but Mills was granted partial immunity for her cooperation and wasn’t charged with a crime.    \n",

            "Message: Kaya Scodelario: ’Nine times out of 10, my character is with a guy twice my age’ Kaya Scodelario makes a lot of sense as the newest Disney princess. She has the big blue eyes beloved of animators and displays a spunky attitude on screen that inspires hero worship in    fledgling feminists. Most importantly, like her Pirates of the Caribbean predecessor, Keira Knightley, Scodelario combines a delicate, aristocratic beauty that gets her cast as   damsels with the sort of wry humour that delights in subverting such outmoded movie nonsense. Carina Smyth, the orphan and “woman of science” she plays in the new Pirates movie is, Scodelario says: “completely from the other side of the tracks. She’s a survivor, she’s independent, she doesn’t wear these fancy clothes and she’s uncomfortable in all of that. That, for me, was quite easy to tap into. ” Today, after a weekend of Disneyland Paris festivities to launch the new film, Scodelario is recovering in a très exclusive Parisian hotel and, amid the Louis XIV grandeur, she appears barefoot, her hair still wet from the shower, dressed in a   and jeans. Now 25, she has been working since she was 14, but boarding this Disney franchise means showbiz on a different scale. She is still getting used to it: “I mean, you walk on set and there’s 500 extras, and there’s a dog that’s an actor and a rat that’s an actor. I tried to pet the dog and they were like: ‘Please don’t, he’s working.’ That was just like, wow. ” Scodelario first came to notice as the enigmatic tearaway Effy Stonem in Skins. The series, which ran from 2007 to 2013, is now best understood as a much druggier, slightly grubbier, British version of Disney’s The Mickey Mouse Club, in that it produced a notable number of actors who have gone on to bigger things. They still get together for Christmas dinners and annual summer barbecues. “Obviously, it’s weird because Nick [Nicholas Hoult] will turn up and he has just been in   and Daniel [Kaluuya] is in Get Out now  —   what the hell? But we kind of get that out of the way in the first 10 minutes and then we go straight back to just joking around and being us. ” Was Scodelario the sort of preternaturally   teenager she appeared to be? She screws up her face in incredulity. “Noooooo! It was always fun to play Effy because she was so different from me. I was incredibly shy and insecure as a child I was bullied, I was dyslexic, I had an immigrant single parent I was the opposite of that kind of ideal, cool girl thing. ” Scodelario was raised speaking Portuguese by her Brazilian mother. “I consider myself a Londoner first and then I consider myself Brazilian, before I consider myself English,” she says. When she was growing up, the two of them lived on the rougher side of the London borough of Islington, in a council flat that was “always bright yellow, with plants and hammocks, Brazilian music and Brazilian food”. This partially explains her bizarre childhood obsession with Arnold Schwarzenegger: “It’s because he was the first foreign actor I ever saw in Hollywood movies. He had an accent and, because my mum had an accent, that really inspired me. I used to look through the Radio Times for his name. I had this huge, long Scodelario name that no one else had and he had this huge name   …     Obviously, as I’ve got older, politically and personally   …     not so great. ” Since leaving Skins in 2009, Scodelario has appeared in several films, including the adaptations of YA novel series The Maze Runner, but it was her first big,   career move that seems most revealing. She was cast as Catherine Earnshaw in 2011’s Wuthering Heights, a bold, passionate take on Emily Brontë’s ultimate teen romance, directed by a   Tank,   Honey Andrea Arnold. “She would say to me: ‘If you come on set and you’re on your period and you’re pissed off, it’s fine your character is on her period and she’s pissed off.’ To have a director say that openly in front of an entire crew? It was like, yes! This is amazing! That’s the dynamic that a woman can bring to a film set. ” It is not a dynamic that one imagines encountering on the set of Jerry Bruckheimer’s   Pirates franchise. So what was the appeal? “The thought of being on set with these actors that have humongous careers [Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Javier Bardem] knowing that I could spend six months learning from them and seeing them work. ” She also had   calculations in mind: “Doing a movie like this means I can finance my own independent movies and, eventually, that’s what I want to do, I want to produce and I want to work with female crews. ” That Disney dollar is not to be sneered at, especially for a “proudly  ” girl from north London. We’re not quite talking    ’      money yet, but still, she says: “What’s great about these movies is there are opportunities like this, where I say to my friends: ‘Get on the Eurostar, come to this nice hotel in Paris, let’s drink some champagne, we’ll go back to work tomorrow. ’” Since filming ended in summer 2015, Scodelario has grown up even more. She married (Benjamin Walker, the American actor and former    of Meryl Streep) and has given birth to a son, who is napping in the adjacent room. Family life has only made her more determined: “I feel kind of empowered now in my career because [my son] is important and my work is important for him. ” It has also given her something to chat about with Depp, although she says there was always an easy camaraderie between them. “I think we got on the second I was there because I tried to treat him as a normal person and I had the same sort of conversation I would have had with a person in a pub. I was just like, ‘Well this is a bit mad, isn’t it? ’” Madder for her, perhaps. As the only woman, then aged 23, in an otherwise   cast of actors in their 40s, 50s and 60s, she has experienced Hollywood’s gender   in spectacular, swashbuckling action. Doesn’t that annoy her? “It does. It’s like there’s this expiry date for us and it’s such bullshit, because my mind isn’t going to change. If anything, I will grow and I will learn and I will be better. ” But she chooses to look on the bright side and, actually, there is one. “I was concerned that they would want me to play a romantic part against someone in their 50s and that would be heartbreaking. So I was extremely relieved that Brenton [Thwaites, who plays the son of Orlando Bloom’s Will Turner] is only a year older than me. But, yeah, nine out of 10 times, if I read a script, it will be me being with a guy that is twice my age, which is really fucking weird. ” Like a lot of actors, Scodelario is keen to maintain normality. In her case, it doesn’t seem like humblebragging or posturing. It is a useful coping strategy for someone whose    experiences have changed so drastically in such a short time. She says that is why she has never burned out, despite working almost constantly since childhood: “I always try to live a normal life alongside it as much as possible. On Skins, we only ever filmed for a couple of months in the summer. When I wasn’t on set, I was doing my normal things. My best friends, they’re my friends from school. One is a florist, one is a nursery teacher they’re completely normal and real. ” She also doesn’t do that annoying     thing of feigning gratitude for any professional experience, however objectively miserable. One of the film’s most dazzling sequences involved her clambering up a ginormous ship’s anchor. It looks   in its CGI glory, but what was it like to shoot? “Hell,” says Scodelario simply. “We were in a giant warehouse that was just blue screen all the way around and we were in there for about three weeks. I didn’t see daylight. We had to constantly be wet, so this poor, lovely makeup lady would come over with a cold bottle of spritzer and apologise and then just spray it in my face, periodically, throughout the day. ” She laughs at the absurdity. Remaining    in Hollywood is one thing, but remaining    while dangling 30ft in the air on a giant prop anchor? That’s an altogether more impressive achievement. • Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (Salazar’s Revenge in the UK) is out on 26 May. Rebecca Nicholson looks at what they did next, Nicholas Hoult (Tony) Hoult was a child actor before he became Skins’    Tony, having starred as Hugh Grant’s impossibly wordy     coach in About a Boy. After Skins, he headed to Hollywood, appeared in Tom Ford’s directorial debut A Single Man, then became a   action star, as   Beast in three   movies and Nux in Mad Max: Fury Road. Dev Patel (Anwar) Patel had his initial experience of the Oscars shortly after Skins, when he starred in Danny Boyle’s Slumdog Millionaire, which won best picture in 2009. But this year he ended up as the show’s first   alumnus, picking up a best supporting actor nod for Lion, in which he   with Nicole Kidman. His next film is Hotel Mumbai, a dramatisation of the terrorist attacks in 2008, which he shot in Adelaide last year. Daniel Kaluuya (Posh Kenneth) Not only did Kaluuya write for Skins, he also occasionally dropped in as the criminally underused Posh Kenneth. Since then, he has been in The Fades, Psychoville, a   Black Mirror  —   he stars in 15 Million Merits, the episode where people ride bikes to gain credits  —   and appeared in   such as Johnny English Reborn and   2. But it was this year’s hit   Get Out, the casting of which provoked the ire of Samuel L Jackson, that made him massive. He is about to follow in Hoult’s Marvel footsteps, having been cast in next year’s Black Panther movie. Kathryn Prescott (Emily) In the second cycle of Skins, Prescott was one half of TV’s sweetest lesbian couple Naomily (so cute, they got a compound). Since then, she has carved out a steady career in US TV, starring in two seasons of MTV’s teen show Finding Carter, about a girl who discovers the woman she thought was her mother had, in fact, abducted her as a baby, and the 24 spinoff, 24: Legacy. Jack O’Connell (Cook) O’Connell shone as the misunderstood   heartthrob of seasons three and four. The   actor has since appeared in several Hollywood movies, including Money Monster, alongside George Clooney, and Unbroken, directed by Angelina Jolie, whom he famously taught to say: “Ey up, me duck. ” He is about to appear on stage alongside Sienna Miller at the Young Vic, in Benedict Andrews’s Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and has signed on to play Alexander McQueen in a new biopic of the designer directed by 45 Years’ Andrew Haigh.\n",

            "Message: Man who drove car at French troops had jihadi propaganda in computer:  prosecutor  French investigators found jihadist propaganda material on Saturday in the computer of a man who drove his car into troops guarding a mosque in southern France on New Year’s Day but said it did not prove he had links with any terrorist groups. ”The inspection of his computer led to the discovery of jihadi propaganda images,” local prosecutor Alex Perrin told Reuters. ”These are downloadable images that are a few weeks old. Not the worst type of images, but rather bellicose slogans,” he said. ”It shows he had an appreciation of that but it does not prove he had links with terrorist organizations.” The   old Frenchman of Tunisian descent rammed his car into a group of four soldiers in a car park outside a large mosque in a suburb of Valence on Friday afternoon, the prosecutor told reporters earlier on Saturday. He said earlier there was no evidence of him belonging to any terrorist group and it seemed he had acted alone. ”He reportedly shouted ’Allah is great’ which suggests some sort of religious element.”  ”When he was apprehended, he mentioned the fact that he wanted to kill troops because troops killed people,” the prosecutor added. ”He said he wanted to be killed by troops.”  There was also no indication that the man was suffering from mental illness, the prosecutor said. He had been unemployed for several years and was not known to police or intelligence services, the prosecutor added.  The practicing Muslim lived in a suburb of Lyon, 100 km (60 miles) north of the town of Valence where the incident took place. ”He had come to Valence, where his    lives, for the end of year holiday,” the prosecutor said. He was shot in the legs and arm by the troops and was still in hospital on Saturday. A soldier and a Muslim man were also slightly injured in the incident. French television showed an amateur video of the soldiers surrounding the red Peugeot estate car and shouting ”get out” before shooting, with the vehicle ending up in a ditch. France has been on high alert since Islamic State militants killed 130 people in Paris on Nov. 13. Soldiers are protecting sensitive places across the country, including official buildings and religious sites. A string of similar but unrelated ”lone wolf” attacks took place at the end of 2014. French Defence Minister   Le Drian, speaking during a trip to Jordan, praised the troops’ restraint in the incident ”They were totally up to the task,” he said.  (Additional reporting by Marine Pennetier in Amman, writing by Michel Rose; editing by Susan Thomas and David Evans)   The U. S. military assured Americans on Wednesday that it was capable of defending the United States against any threat from North Korea’s newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) which Pyongyang says can carry a large nuclear warhead. CARACAS The Venezuelan police officer who staged a helicopter attack on government buildings in Caracas last week appeared in an internet video on Wednesday vowing to continue fighting for the ”liberation” of his country. \n",

            "Message: WATCH: Tracking Lightning Strikes, From Space Updated at 3:30 p. m. ET, A new weather satellite parked 22, 300 miles above Earth has sent back its first images of lightning storms on our planet, and they are, well, pretty flashy. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the satellite, released the first image from a new instrument, a lightning detector. It shows lightning flashes over the course of an hour on Valentine’s Day, from the Gulf of Mexico down to the southern coast of South America. The agency also released the video below showing images of the lightning storms developing over southeast Texas on that day  —   part of the same system that created the bright blotch of lightning activity in the hemispheric image above. In the video, the green dotted lines designate the Texas and Louisiana coastlines. Tornadoes from that storm system destroyed homes near Houston. NOAA hopes information about lightning can help weather forecasters predict severe weather, including tornadoes, more accurately. The video animation strings together images from the weather satellite’s Geostationary Lightning Mapper to simulate ”what your eye might see from above the clouds,” according to the technical caption. Unlike traditional   animations that appear jerky because the images are presented more quickly than they were gathered, this video is a slower version of what the satellite sees, brought down from the satellite’s 500 frames per second to a more human 25 frames per second. In its announcement, NOAA called the lightning detector images ”data never before available to forecasters,” and expressed high hopes for what such information could do for disaster preparedness and response: ”During heavy rain, [lightning detector] data will show when thunderstorms are stalled or if they are gathering strength. When combined with radar and other satellite data, [lightning detector] data may help forecasters anticipate severe weather and issue flood and flash flood warnings sooner. In dry areas, especially in the western United States, information from the instrument will help forecasters, and ultimately firefighters, identify areas prone to wildfires sparked by lightning.” ”As you can imagine, we are pretty excited here at NOAA Satellites,” spokesperson Connie Barclay told NPR in an email. ”Lightning strikes the U. S. on average of 25 million times each year, and kills on average 49 people in the U. S. each year.” Earlier this year, the same weather satellite, known as   sent back its first   images of the sun. As we have reported,   launched in November 2016 and is still in a testing phase: ”  was launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla. in December and is a collaboration between NOAA and NASA. When it is fully up and running, the satellite will ’provide images of weather pattern and severe storms as frequently as every 30 seconds, which will contribute to more accurate and reliable weather forecasts and severe weather outlooks,’ according to its mission overview page. . .. ”  is in geostationary orbit, meaning its location does not move relative to the ground below it. It is 22, 300 miles above Earth. Its imaging device measures 16 different ’spectral bands,’ including two that are visible to the human eye and 14 that we experience as heat.” If all the tests go according to plan, the satellite will be fully operational in November, and a second, similar satellite that’s currently being tested in Colorado will begin operating about nine months later.\n",

            "Message: Megyn Kelly On Trump And The Media: ’We’re In A Dangerous Phase Right Now’ As Donald Trump continues to court controversy via Twitter, Fox News host Megyn Kelly tells Fresh Air’s Terry Gross that the   ”really does need to be aware of the power that he has when he releases these tweets.” Kelly felt that power firsthand in August 2015, when she pressed the candidate about his derogatory comments about women during the first Republican primary debate. Trump responded with a Twitter attack, which was quickly followed up by a barrage of insulting tweets and even death threats from his followers. ”What people don’t realize about Donald Trump  —   and I don’t even know if Donald Trump realizes it  —   is that every tweet he unleashes against you . .. creates such a crescendo of anger,” Kelly says. The host of The Kelly File says that although she worried for her own safety and that of her children, she and her producers were determined not to let the threats impact their coverage of Trump. Now that Trump is the   she is especially concerned about his ” ” of the media. ”I think it’s dangerous,” Kelly says. ”People . .. need good, strong, skeptical journalists to be covering whoever it is  —   whether it’s Barack Obama or President Donald Trump  —   and we’re in a dangerous phase right now, where too many millions of Americans aren’t listening at all to what the press tells them.” Kelly’s new memoir, Settle For More, revisits her feud with Trump, as well as her work as a journalist and her decision to come forward in the sexual harassment case against former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. On how Trump’s rhetoric represents a backlash to the notion of ”PC culture”  There are a lot of people in our society who have had it with PC culture . .. and I, Terry, am one of those people. I think we have gone too far into the PC culture, but there’s a limit to how far we can take that. . .. My general sense is [Trump voters] feel they’ve been lectured to enough on how they’re supposed to speak and how things that were very innocuous or innocent over the past several years were spun back to them . .. and so when Trump came up as this   they said, ”Yes! He’s our champion.” He was given a permission slip for everything he said and did because of that. The gradations of what was appropriate or not seemed to get completely lost. . .. But I would submit to you that Trump’s history of comments on women go well beyond the line, if you look at them in their entirety, past the normal backlash to PC culture. On the fears minority groups have expressed following the election, The relative lack of power of certain minority groups and the fear they’re feeling in the wake of Donald Trump’s election, I think, is something we really need to take a look at, because, while I don’t think Trump wants to target any particular minority group, I understand their fear, because he spent many months stoking it. And so I think that’s a legitimate thing we’re going to have to deal with and ask ourselves how far he can go in enacting certain politics that target specific groups. On the threatening and misogynist tweets Kelly received from Trump supporters  The   was in thousands of tweets directed at me  —   lots of threats to beat the hell out of me, to rape me, honestly the ugliest things you can imagine. But most of this stuff I was able to just dismiss as angry people who are trying to scare me, you know. However, there were so many that rose to the level of ”OK, that one we need to pay attention to,” that it did become alarming. It wasn’t like I walked down the street in constant fear of someone trying to take my life, but I was very aware of it. The thing I was most worried about was that I have a   and a   and a    and I was worried I’d be walking down the street with my kids and somebody would do something to me in front of them they would see me get punched in the face or get hurt. On how to cover news from Trump’s Twitter feed, It’s a challenge, there’s no question, because some of these tweets I would submit to you are bait, you know? Maybe an attempt to distract from a news story that Donald Trump doesn’t love, and he’s holding the shiny object up in an attempt to say: ”Look over here! Look over here!” We saw him do this many times throughout the primary campaign, so my approach on The Kelly File is to try to use my judgment as to whether that’s what this is. Is this a head fake to distract from something that’s in the news, or is this worthy of us running and chewing on it, like a dog with a bone? . .. Donald Trump and the First Amendment, it’s not a beautiful match it’s not a match made in heaven. Between the free speech rights that he has not defended and the freedom of the press, which he has not defended, it’s problematic. On deciding to come forward about Roger Ailes’ sexual harassment, more than 10 years later, When it happened to me, I did bring it to a supervisor, which is what you’re supposed to do. . .. I knew very well what my legal rights and obligations were, but let me just start with this: . .. So many ask, ”Why didn’t you report it sooner?” . .. And I would submit to you that the appropriate question to ask a victim of sexual harassment is not ”Why didn’t you report it sooner?” You don’t get to ask me that until you’ve asked me whether there was a safe avenue for reporting in my company, and only if the answer to that question is ”yes” do you get to ask the next question. The problem that we had at Fox, like so many other companies in America right now, was that there was not a safe avenue for reporting. Here was the CEO and chairman of the board, on industry publications as the most powerful man in news, harassing young women in the company like myself who had been there for 12 months, and who typically were in a vulnerable position. In my case, I was new to the company and going through a divorce, but I know of other cases where certain women had just suffered a death in the family or were also having a divorce, or were on their job interview . .. not in a position of power and at their most vulnerable, in a way. On how Trump’s election has empowered white nationalists and the ” ” movement, It is also a dangerous game to empower them, as clearly has happened. I mean, Steve Bannon is the chief adviser to our   and I understand the argument that he’s just a provocateur and he comes up with these crazy headlines and they want clicks, but if you look at what’s happened to Breitbart [News] over the last three years, it’s shocking. I knew Andrew Breitbart very well and he was great. I loved him. He was a true provocateur who would be fun about it, you know. He’d show up at a democratic protest and engage with the protesters and then he’d go have a beer with them. This is something else entirely, and I don’t know that Trump can stop it. I don’t know who, if anyone, can stop it. I think right now the answer is for good people to exercise their own voice and their own power.\n",

            "Message: All the times Trump personally attacked judges — and why his tirades are ‘worse than wrong’           Dealing with another legal blow that blocked another executive order this week, President Trump did something familiar. He attacked the judiciary. Again. And ever so aggressively. A White House statement Tuesday about a federal district judge’s ruling on Trump’s executive order on “sanctuary cities” did not mince words. It emphasized  —   more than once  —   that the judge who just ruled against the administration is not an elected official. “The San Francisco judge’s erroneous ruling is a gift to the criminal gang and cartel element in our country, empowering the worst kind of human trafficking and sex trafficking, and putting thousands of innocent lives at risk,” the statement said. “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge. ”   [Trump blasts ‘ridiculous’ court ruling that blocked his order on sanctuary cities]   On Tuesday, U. S. District Judge William H. Orrick in San Francisco blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funding from “sanctuary” jurisdictions  —   cities or towns that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities. The tweet storm from the president came early the following day, when Trump lashed out at the wrong court, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which he said had issued a “ridiculous” ruling. The 9th Circuit had previously ruled against Trump’s original travel ban barring citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries and refugees from entering the United States. But the ruling on “sanctuary cities” was issued by the U. S. District Court for California’s Northern District. The federal appellate court, however, is likely to hear an appeal on Orrick’s ruling. Trump vowed to take the case to the country’s highest court. “I’m never surprised at the 9th Circuit,” the president said Wednesday when asked about the ruling halting his   order, again referring to the wrong court. “As I said, we’ll see them in the Supreme Court. ”   First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary   ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2017     . ..the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this ”judge shopping!” Messy system.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2017   Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor with expertise on judicial conduct and ethics, said Trump is sending a dangerous message in his latest attack on the judiciary: “As the leader of the free world, I should be able to do what I choose. The court shouldn’t be able to get involved. ” Geyh said that attitude shows a lack of understanding of the equal roles of the three branches of government, specifically of the judiciary’s job to serve as a check on the executive branch.   [Sanctuary cities ruling: When a judge quotes Sean Spicer, it’s not a good sign for the White House]   “Presidents have disagreed with court rulings all the time. What’s unusual is he’s essentially challenging the legitimacy of the court’s role. And he’s doing that without any reference to applicable law,” Geyh told The Washington Post. “That they are blocking his order is all the evidence he needs that they are exceeding their authority. ” “That’s worse than wrong,” Geyh added. “On some level, that’s dangerous. ” Trump has largely lost in legal battles over his administration’s immigration policies. And with almost each unfavorable ruling, Trump has responded aggressively. In February, he ripped into a Washington state federal judge who temporarily blocked enforcement of his travel ban. U. S. District Judge James L. Robart wrote that the court is “one of three equal branches of our federal government. ” In a Saturday morning tweet storm after Robart’s ruling, Trump said, “The opinion of this   judge, which essentially takes   away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned. ”   [Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch says Trump’s attacks on judiciary are ‘demoralizing’]   Trump’s attacks on the judiciary, specifically on Robart, even brought a response from his own Supreme Court nominee,   Neil M. Gorsuch, who told a senator that the criticism was “disheartening” and “demoralizing” to independent federal courts, The Post reported. But a few days later, Trump criticized the judiciary again after watching an oral argument in which three 9th Circuit judges hearing an appeal on Robart’s ruling aggressively questioned the government’s lawyers. “And I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased. And we haven’t made a decision yet,” Trump said. “But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great if our justice system  —   if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right. ” The 9th Circuit, which has jurisdiction over district courts in several   states, unanimously upheld Robart’s ruling and rejected the government’s argument that the travel ban serves any national security purpose. Echoing Robart, the appeals court judges asserted the judiciary’s ability to check the president’s power. The president angrily tweeted minutes after the ruling was issued: “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!”   [Trump’s personal, racially tinged attacks on federal judge alarm legal experts]   Later, in March, Trump blasted two federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland who had blocked a   version of his travel ban. He called the Hawaii judge’s ruling “terrible” during a rally in Nashville and said it was politically motivated. Trumps’s attacks on the federal judiciary began even before he took office. U. S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was the target of racially tinged remarks by the Republican presidential nominee last June. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said that Curiel’s ethnicity should have disqualified him from presiding over fraud lawsuits against the   Trump University. He argued that because of his   immigration policies, having a judge of Mexican heritage preside over a lawsuit against him presented an “absolute conflict” of interest. “I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He’s a hater,” Trump said at a campaign rally in San Diego in June 2016, after Curiel ordered the release of internal documents detailing predatory marketing practices at Trump University. “They ought to look into Judge Curiel because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace. Okay?” Although Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle those lawsuits, his administration is facing Curiel again. The   judge is presiding over a California lawsuit filed on behalf of a young man whom immigration advocates say is one of the first “Dreamers” to be deported under Trump.

            "Message: Hollywood mobilizes against Trump Los Angeles (CNN) Hollywood and Washington conservatives have never gotten along. But the call to action in this town is hitting a new level during the early days of President Donald Trump’s administration. The entertainment industry’s general antipathy toward Trump was on full display Sunday at the Oscars, where references to the President’s controversial actions during his first month in office were center stage. ”I want to say thank you to President Trump,” host Jimmy Kimmel said in his opening monologue.  ”I mean, remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?” In a reference to Trump’s targeted travel ban and his administration’s stance on immigration, Kimmel joked that in Hollywood ”we don’t discriminate against people based on where they’re from, we discriminate against them based on their age and weight.” He trolled Trump on Twitter and also offered fake mockery of Meryl Streep, who was targeted by Trump earlier this year after she attacked him in a fiery speech at the Golden Globes.  Beyond the jokes which were threaded throughout the evening, perhaps the strongest   statement of the night was from Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, who won the Oscar in the foreign language category for ”The Salesman.” He announced days earlier that he would not travel to the Oscars as a form of protest against Trump’s travel ban    blocked by federal courts    affecting seven predominantly Muslim nations. In a statement read by his associate, Farhadi said his absence was out of respect for the people of his and the other six countries. Oscars: The winners list, ”Dividing the world into the ’us’ and ’our enemies’ categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war,” Farhadi’s statement said. ”These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression.”  Of course, protests from Hollywood often play in the GOP’s hands. Republicans have long dismissed criticism from the entertainment industry as further proof that it’s out of touch, part of the ”coastal elite” and an ATM for the political left. Trump, who is leveling similar charges against the news media and announced this weekend he won’t attend the   White House Correspondents’ Dinner, is sure to do the same. Remaining politically engaged, But there is a difference this year: the insistence of many entertainers industry players that they will remain politically engaged throughout Trump’s tenure    not just on the   stages of awards ceremonies. The political jabs that dominated the Oscars were really a continuation of Hollywood’s rise to resistance over the past month. There was a   lineup in Washington in January at the women’s march that included Scarlett Johansson and Madonna, who said she would not accept ”the new age of tyranny.” Chelsea Handler and Charlize Theron led a sister march in Park City, Utah, near the Sundance Film Festival.  Then Trump’s targeted travel ban caused collective outrage across the entertainment industry. United Talent Agency, one of the world’s largest talent agencies, canceled its traditional Oscars party and instead made a $250, 000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union. They opted to hold a    rally where speakers blasted the Trump agenda. Shortly after the travel ban was announced, Ari Emanuel, a   agent to Trump, told   talent agency employees that he and his   Patrick Whitesell, were forming a federal political action committee. Though Emanuel has not spoken publicly about the focus of the PAC, one source familiar with the plans said many of the agency’s employees were profoundly shaken by the travel ban    which affected some of its clients. Emanuel and Whitesell plan to seek input from employees about where to direct PAC funds. Meanwhile, three days before the Oscars, the Creative Artists Agency held a ”Take Action Day” for agents, clients, executives and their guests. The   event included panels on criminal justice, the environment and immigration. The immigration panel featured a DACA recipient, as well as activists who described the legal workshops they have been holding for undocumented immigrants, outlining their rights and how to respond if an ICE agent shows up at their door. The day was capped with    appearances from California Sen. Kamala Harris and Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Earlier in the day, House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, also appeared before CAA for a question and answer session. Harris urged the film executives to get involved in volunteer work while also giving to immigrant aid groups and other legal   that are working in communities. ”We have to be in this for the long haul,” she said, describing the resistance on the left as ”a process.” ”We can’t peak. ..and then throw up our hands.” Connected to politics, Christy Haubeggar, a CAA agent who represents Salma Hayek and Eva Longoria, among others, noted in an interview that many in the entertainment community feel more profoundly connected to politics this year. ”The urgency of a lot of the issues facing the nation, we maybe don’t feel as intensely, because we are a little bit insulated and a little bit protected from some of those by virtue of the fact that we all live in a few zip codes,” said Haubeggar, who founded Latina Magazine and hosted CAA’s immigration panel on Thursday. ”The thing that has taken on a greater sense of urgency is the dynamic of an administration and election that revealed a cacophony of issues at one time,” Haubeggar said. ”I think it’s more than a moment, I think it’s a movement. The fact that we are living a civics lesson in real time is its own gift of sorts. We are in a moment that feels acute and urgent.” UTA kicked off Oscar weekend in Los Angeles with a Friday afternoon rally outside its headquarters featuring Jodie Foster and Michael J. Fox. Many of the speakers argued the industry had a powerful role to play in shaping perceptions and breaking stereotypes through storytelling. ”This is a singular time in history, and it’s time to show up,” Foster said in her speech. ”It makes me so proud to see so many people engaging in support for civil rights and our traditions of fairness, freedom and empathy.” Fox, who has been active for many years in Washington on issues such as stem cell research, urged the crowd to unite and never surrender ”our shared values of compassion, and human dignity, and freedom of expression, religion and the arts.” Jeremy Zimmer, the CEO of UTA, called on rally participants to raise their ”voices loud and clear.” ”The politics of fear and division do not reflect who we are as a nation,” he said.

            "Message: The Next Fight to Expand Voting Has Already Begun One of the many supposed truisms about politics is that you’re never supposed to look past the next election. Yet as this historic presidential race draws to a close, voting rights advocates are already ramping up efforts to expand the rolls in future elections through automatic voter registration. In the District of Columbia, the city council this week unanimously approved legislation allowing eligible citizens to register when they sign up for a driver’s license. In Nevada, organizers for a group led by Obama campaign veterans are gathering signatures to put a similar law on the ballot in 2018 they must submit the petition by Election Day this year. Voters in Alaska will decide a ballot measure next week that would automatically register nonvoters when they sign up to receive dividend payments from the state’s oil revenue fund. And in Illinois, Democrats in the state legislature are hoping to hold a vote in the weeks after November 8 to override Republican Governor Bruce Rauner’s veto of legislation enshrining automatic voter registration. A Tipping Point for Automatic Voter Registration? The   push comes after a flurry of activity around the issue earlier this year that saw both progress and setbacks. In addition to D. C. Vermont, West Virginia, and Connecticut all followed the lead of Oregon and California in changing the voter registration process from a system in which people must “opt in” to one in which they have to affirmatively “opt out. ” But in three   states with Republican governors —  Illinois, New Jersey, and Maryland —  bills enacting automatic voter registration fell short or were vetoed. By and large, Republicans have opposed the efforts and argued that the push is a   bid to boost Democratic votes and that the onus should remain on citizens themselves, rather than the government, to register to vote. In vetoing the Illinois bill in August, Rauner cited concerns that the legislation did not adequately ensure that state officials would verify a person’s eligibility before adding them to the rolls. “I strongly support efforts to encourage greater voter participation in our democracy and share the goals of this legislation,” Rauner said in a statement at the time. “Unfortunately, as currently drafted, the bill would inadvertently open the door to voter fraud and run afoul of federal election law. ” In New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie vetoed a similar bill, expressing the same worries. Despite those setbacks, advocates for   “motor voter” laws say they are making inroads with Republicans. “There has been an increased number of instances where automatic voter registration is being supported in a bipartisan way,” said Hari Sevugan, spokesman for iVote, the advocacy group that is pushing the issue aggressively in Illinois, Nevada, and elsewhere. The organization’s mission is to go “on offense” on expanding access and participation in elections instead of simply fighting a rearguard battle against voter ID laws and other restrictions that make voting more difficult. Sevugan cited as examples a “grand bargain” that was struck in West Virginia, a state that has shifted red in the last two decades, and the push in Alaska, another red state where both Republican senators support the ballot measure. And while Democrats in the Illinois legislature carried the bill, it drew votes from some Republicans in both chambers. iVote has bought ads in recent days thanking the Republican lawmakers for their support, largely in the hope that those same members will vote to override Rauner’s veto later this year. “We think the votes would be there,” Sevugan said. Whether the measure comes up for another vote is still unclear, as the first priority for the Illinois legislature after the election will be passing a budget. The campaign in Nevada is seen as particularly important because of how fast the state’s population has grown in recent years. In D. C. on the other hand, the impact of the new law would be limited because the city has no voting representation in Congress. In 2017, Governor Andrew Cuomo is expected to push for passage of an automatic voter registration proposal he unveiled earlier this year, especially if Democrats win back the state Senate and gain full control of the legislature. Advocates might also renew their efforts in Maryland, New Jersey, and in Washington State, where a bill passed in one legislative chamber but stalled in the other. Oregon remains the only state that has actually implemented a motor voter law. It did so in January, and in the first nine months, state officials reported adding about 230, 000 people to the voter rolls, an increase of about 10 percent. Most Oregonians chose the default option of registering as unaffiliated, meaning neither party gained a significant advantage. About nine percent of citizens chose to opt out of the system and forego registration. “There’s a nice    there,” Sevugan said.\n",

            "Message: As Trump rolls again, opposition has one week to stop him  The Republican presidential campaign has entered what could be the most critical week of the primary season, with the party elites almost out of time to deny the GOP nomination to New York billionaire Donald Trump short of a potentially bloody fight at the national convention in July. Trump’s easy victories in Michigan and Mississippi demonstrated appeal from the Deep South to the industrial Midwest that continued his impressive winning string and added to his lead in delegates. While not unexpected, his margins  —   especially in Michigan  —   were bigger than his rivals had hoped they would be. So far his opponents have won only scattered victories by comparison but nothing that amounts to critical mass in the   movement. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has done better than Ohio Gov. John Kasich or Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, but none has yet emerged as strong enough alone to stop him, though Cruz may be best positioned to fill that role. After Tuesday, the   movement’s   strategy rests on two candidates and two states: Kasich in Ohio and Rubio in Florida. But Tuesday showed there are no sure things ahead. Kasich has yet to win a contest and was looking for a clear and strong finish in Michigan to give him a boost. Instead he finished well behind Trump in Michigan and was in a fight with Cruz for second.     Tracking the race to the Republican nomination View Graphic     Tracking the race to the Republican nomination  Meanwhile, Tuesday continued Rubio’s sudden and rapid descent. A few weeks ago, he was the establishment favorite, the man seen as best positioned to challenge Trump through the spring. Today he is a battered candidate. In Michigan, Rubio was scratching to reach double digits in the popular vote. That was impressive, compared with his showing in Mississippi, where he was mired in single digits, along with Kasich. In that state, as Trump romped, Cruz lapped the other two and finished second. It’s not out of the question that Kasich and Rubio could win their home states next week, but after what happened Tuesday, they will face heavy competition, and not just from Trump. Cruz also sees vulnerabilities in his rivals and will seek to exploit them. All of this comes despite signs that Trump, who has dominated the Republican race and defined the 2016 cycle for months with his bombastic rhetoric and unorthodox campaign style, has begun to show weakness and limits. As opposition to his candidacy has mounted inside the Republican Party, the lines have hardened around his candidacy, pro and con. In national polls, his margin is narrower than it once was. Nearly half of all Republicans say they would not be satisfied if he becomes the nominee, according to the latest Washington   News poll. His favorability rating among Republicans, while still net positive, has declined over the past few months. And in    tests against Cruz and Rubio, he loses, according to the same poll. Had this begun to happen two months ago, Trump might be far more vulnerable than he looks today  —   or so some Republicans would like to think. But even that is open to question. The party elites unloaded on Trump over the past week, led by 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who portrayed Trump as unfit to be president and a lousy businessman. Wealthy donors offered up millions of dollars to   super PACs for attack ads.     View Graphic      None of it seemed to have much effect Tuesday, although the focus of these efforts is targeted more on next week’s results. Up to now, according to the Republican rules, almost all states so far have awarded delegates on a proportional basis. But that begins to change next week in a way designed to help a   and hinder those behind. Starting next week, many states will award delegates on a    basis. Trump doesn’t have to win half the vote to get all the delegates in upcoming states; he can do so with the kind of percentages he has rolled up so far. Trump still remains far short of the 1, 237 delegates needed to win the nomination. Losses in Ohio and Florida would block him from 165 delegates. But winning either or both would cripple efforts to prevent him from becoming the nominee. The possibility of a convention fight still looms. As of Tuesday night, more than 1, 000 delegates have been awarded. After next Tuesday, that jumps to almost 1, 500  —   of 2, 472 total. Trump still could be denied a   victory, but which among his rivals would be close enough to claim the right to be the alternative? Rubio’s prospects have faded dramatically. He needs a stunning turnaround, beginning in Florida and then elsewhere. Kasich could win Ohio. If he were to do that, other Midwestern states could be fertile territory, but after what happened Tuesday in Michigan, he could not count on them. Cruz and his advisers long have believed that a    race would favor him over Trump. But a look at the calendar after next week raises questions about his path. So far, other than his victory in Texas, he has had trouble demonstrating that he has support that is significantly broader than his evangelical base. Right now, Cruz has done less well overall than former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who had a similar base of support, did in 2012. Both won the Iowa caucuses. Santorum went on to win 10 more states. Of the seven that have voted already this year, Cruz has won two, Rubio one and Trump four. Cruz can win caucus states and some smaller contests. His real test will come in states such as Wisconsin, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and California. Trump is still an unusual    —   polarizing in his own party and with vulnerabilities that become more apparent week by week. Were he to falter next week or after that, the   forces will be emboldened to continue their attacks. Their hope remains to keep him short of a majority and then upend him in Cleveland in July. But they needed a better result on Tuesday than they got. Trump remains in control of the race.  \n",

            "Message: These famous athletes are advocating for marijuana as a workout tool  The District recently marked the first anniversary of its legalization of recreational marijuana. And as the city is home to so many   people, it’s likely that at least a few of them are wondering whether it makes sense, or whether it’s even safe, to incorporate pot into their exercise regimens. Given the   illegality of marijuana, there is not a large body of evidence about its effects on the human body. However, I spoke with a professional athlete who offered his own large body as testimony to the benefits of engaging in physical activity while stoned. Activity hardly gets more physical  —   and grueling  —   than professional wrestling, and at 45, Rob Van Dam not only has been at it for well over two decades, he has performed at the highest level it has to offer. Van Dam’s real name is Robert Szatkowski. He was given his ring name by a promoter who thought he resembled the Belgian   movie star   Van Damme (not his real name, either, by the way). Van Dam once held the Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Entertainment championships simultaneously, and, as one of the most acrobatic performers pro wrestling has ever seen, he remains a fan favorite to this day.  [How to turn a fitness goal into a lifetime of good health (fluctuating weight included)]  Another aspect in which the      Van Dam has stood out is his predilection for marijuana, which not only became a major part of his ring persona but also forms a very real part of his daily life. When reached by phone at his home in California, he explained to me that he doesn’t think of it as a performance enhancer so much as a “life enhancer. ” “I’ve been known to apply smoking to everything throughout the day,” he said. In particular, marijuana has helped him in “thinking good thoughts, because . . . in front of millions of people that paid to see you at your best, who expect you to be in   shape and condition on that particular night for that moment, you’ve got to deliver. ” There is widespread agreement that marijuana can put users in a relaxed and positive frame of mind (although some can experience feelings of anxiety and paranoia) and for that reason, it can be considered a   drug, providing an athlete serenity and confidence he or she might not otherwise have had. However, some of the science on marijuana also points to physical impairments. Gary Wadler, a noted authority on drugs in sports and an official with the World   Agency, has acknowledged marijuana’s role in “decreasing anxiety” but has also written that use adversely affects motor skills, reaction times,   coordination, perceptual accuracy, maximal exercise capacity and concentration. A 2006 article in the British Journal of Sports Medicine stated that THC, the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana, “engenders a certain heaviness, marked relaxation, and excessive fatigue of the limbs. ” The article also noted that, because the product is usually smoked, that practice can have “detrimental effects on the lungs, oral cavity and upper respiratory tract. ”  [Tired of treadmills? Don’t underestimate the elliptical.]  On the other hand, a 2012 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found, for all but the heaviest users, “no evidence that increasing exposure to marijuana adversely affects pulmonary function. ” In fact, the study found some evidence of increased lung capacity, possibly because of users’ penchants for taking and sustaining deep inhalations. Of course, no one needs massive lung capacity more than Olympic swimmers, and arguably the greatest of all time, Michael Phelps, was infamously photographed taking a bong hit, for which he apologized repeatedly. But while Phelps has called his actions “regrettable,” several other sports stars have, like Van Dam, become cannabis advocates. Ross Rebagliati of Canada won the first Olympic gold medal ever handed out for snowboarding, in 1998, then briefly had it taken away when he tested positive for marijuana, before officials realized that it wasn’t (yet) on their list of banned substances. Rebagliati subsequently went into the   business, and when reached by phone in British Columbia, he said, “The focus and the motivation combined [that cannabis provides] gives you a better workout, more often. “As an athlete, there’s a lot of repetitive working out that goes on,” said Rebagliati, 44, “and going to the gym two, three hours a day for five days a week for years on end” gets monotonous. “To be able to spice it up in a natural way for an athlete is the best possible thing. ” He added that, “as far as focus is concerned” while high, he had “never seen anything like it. ” “All the distractions of your phone, the people next to you working out, it just goes away, and you’re just going to pound out the workout,” he said. Another athlete moving into the world of marijuana entre pre neur ship is Cliff Robinson, who had an   career in the National Basketball Association and was the 1993 Sixth Man of the Year. Robinson was suspended twice for marijuana use, causing some wags to change his nickname, “Uncle Cliffy,” to “Uncle Spliffy,” and now he is using the latter moniker as the name of his new   venture, which promises to produce “marijuana designed for athletes, also known as Sports Cannabis. ”  [What you get out of trendy fitness classes like Insanity and SoulCycle  —   and what you don’t]  Van Dam, too, was once suspended from his sport, after a 2006 incident in which police found him to be in possession of a large quantity of marijuana. That incident effectively ended his nascent reign atop the WWE, but it hardly made him less determined to promote cannabis. He points out that marijuana comes in different strains and that some, particularly in the sativa species, are better suited for   activities, while others, often in the indica species, are more associated with classic “stoner” (i. e.  ) behavior. “If I want to relax and just chill out, consuming cannabis can help with that,” Van Dam said. “If I want to be active, if I’m going to go work out or have a match, then it can help with that, too. ” Some warn that marijuana’s propensity to elevate users’ heart rates poses a threat of cardiovascular events that can be increased through exercise. Rebagliati speculated that significant   problems might be a result of consuming too much marijuana in given sessions. “There’s a sweet spot for everybody,” he said, noting that athletes getting into marijuana should start with “one small puff. ” Rebagliati also posited that marijuana can increase metabolism and referred to a recent study that concluded that, counter to the traditional perception of pot, it helps users lower their average body mass index. That study suggested those reductions in weight were, for younger users, most likely attributed to choosing marijuana over   alcohol. For older users, the study suggested that they were getting   benefits, contributing to “an increase in physical wellness and frequent exercise. ” And if there is a topic on which Van Dam is an expert, it’s pain management. Pro wrestling matches sometimes stretch to exhausting lengths of up to half an hour, during which performers subject themselves to “the dives, the crashes, the falls to the floor, the slams, the suplexes, the power bombs through the tables. ” Van Dam estimated that he undergoes the equivalent of “50 car crashes in 10 minutes in the ring” and has had “hundreds of concussions. ” Of course, folks thinking about getting high for, say, their evening runs don’t have to worry about that kind of damage. They also might not react to marijuana as positively as Van Dam and Rebagliati have  —   everyone has his or her own internal chemistry  —   but the pair at least offer examples of athletes who were able to reach impressive heights while getting high.  @desbieler on Twitter    More from The Washington Post:     want NFL to fund research on marijuana treatments for brain injuries   NFL GM says ’30 to 40 percent of players in this draft class use marijuana regularly’   You’ve heard sleep is crucial to your workout routine.

            "Message: An Oklahoma Newspaper Endorsed Clinton. It Hasn’t Been Forgiven.  ENID, Okla.  —   One Sunday after church, Jeff Mullin and his wife were in line at the Western Sizzlin steakhouse here when a man, fists clenched, threatened to beat the hell out of him. “My first thought was just to kind of try to keep things calm. Otherwise, it was going to be two old guys rolling around on the floor of the steakhouse, and that would be pretty unseemly,” recalled Mr. Mullin, 64, the mustachioed senior writer for Enid’s daily newspaper, The Enid News  Eagle. The dispute was not personal. It was, of all things, editorial. Mr. Mullin’s red newspaper in a red county in what is arguably the reddest of states went blue this campaign season and endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. The editorial board, in a   column on Page A4 on Oct. 9, wrote that Donald J. Trump lacked “the skills, experience or temperament to hold office. ” The headline and subhead read: “For U. S. president: Hillary Clinton is our choice for commander in chief. ” It was the first Democratic endorsement for president in the modern history of the newspaper, which was founded in 1893. As the man’s reaction at the steakhouse suggested, Enid was stunned, and this   agricultural town of 52, 000 near the Kansas state line has not been the same since. The News  Eagle, with a circulation of 10, 000, lost 162 subscribers who canceled the paper. Eleven advertisers pulled their ads, including a funeral home that had a sizable account. Someone stuck a “Crooked Hillary” bumper sticker on the glass doors of the paper’s downtown office. A man left a   message on the publisher’s voice mail, expressing his hope that readers would deliver, to put it delicately, a burning sack of steaming excrement to the paper. Around the country, as newspapers big and small are struggling to keep subscribers, a handful of papers with conservative editorial boards made news by either endorsing Mrs. Clinton or urging readers to back anybody but Mr. Trump. Among them were The Dallas Morning News and The Fort Worth  . The Arizona Republic in Phoenix received death threats after it endorsed a Democrat for president for the first time in its   history. Yet for the most part, the fallout at those large metropolitan newspapers was   and barely noticed. The  ’s editorial in October, “Say No to Trump,” led to more than 100 canceled subscriptions, less than   of 1 percent of its circulation. In Enid, however, sentiment about the endorsement lingers weeks after the election. A former mayor, Doug Frantz, 72, withdrew his participation in this year’s Pillar of the Plains events, which are sponsored by the paper and honor community leaders and volunteers. Emails, letters, phone calls and comments denouncing the endorsement have poured into the paper’s website and Facebook page,  and online, the editorial logged more than 20, 000 page views the week it was published, making it one of the most viewed articles to ever run on Enidnews. com. Days after the editorial, Paul Allen, 81, one of Enid’s most prominent residents  —   he financed construction of the ballpark downtown  —   stepped into the paper’s offices on Broadway. He walked past the statue of an eagle in the lobby and canceled his    subscription at the front desk. He might have done it sooner, but hesitated because he knows the publisher, Jeff L. Funk, whom he sees at weekly Rotary Club meetings. “I like Jeff a lot,” said Mr. Allen, a   of a meat processing company that is the largest private employer in town. “That was one reason I debated it, because I didn’t want to offend him. “I wasn’t gloating over it,” he continued. “I just felt like it was kind of my duty almost. When I saw that headline, I was shocked. It was sickening to me. ” The News  Eagle’s   editorial showed the raw power of partisanship in   America, the extraordinary divisions exposed in this election and the surprising ways in today’s digital media age that newspaper endorsements still have the power to generate a reaction, even if they don’t necessarily change people’s votes. “There used to be a saying that the editorial page was the soul of a newspaper, and if that’s the case, we’ve got a lot of   newspapers in the country because they’re afraid to offend anybody,” said Terry M. Clark, the director of the Oklahoma Journalism Hall of Fame and a professor of journalism at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond. “This is an excellent example of the way American journalism ought to be  —   standing for something  —   and, man, it takes guts to do that in Enid, Okla. ” The News  Eagle, which urged readers in the Republican primary to support Senator Marco Rubio for president, stands by its endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. But it has also been busy doing damage control. One reader who stopped taking the paper said it was still trying to woo him back by delivering an occasional copy to his doorstep. The executive editor, Rob Collins, has worked the phones, talking to subscribers who had canceled or threatened to do so. “I talked a lot of people off the ledge,” said Mr. Collins, who grew up in Enid and whose father was a respected car salesman. “People knew my dad or know my mom and know my family here. A lot of people who were angry called expecting me to argue right back with them. Really, the only time I would raise my voice is when I would get cursed at or yelled at, which I don’t really like. “I hope people can respect that we’re entitled to our opinion, too, and that that can be different from news,” he added. The editorial took shape from notes that Mr. Funk, the publisher, supplied to Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins refined the notes and was the primary author of the endorsement, which was debated and approved by the paper’s   editorial board. The paper’s corporate parent, Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. which is based in Alabama and owns newspapers and websites in 23 states, also played a role. “It was our decision at the corporate level, which of course was made known to all of our papers, that Donald Trump did not meet our company and journalism values, particularly as they related to the First Amendment,” said Bill Ketter, the senior vice president for news. Asked if the Enid editorial board had the freedom to endorse Mr. Trump, he replied: “Let me put it this way. We would have been disappointed. Did we demand that they do something? No, we didn’t do that. We set out our principles and our standards. ” Enid is roughly 100 miles north of Oklahoma City, and people here still like to debate whether the town gets its name from a character in a Tennyson poem or, according to urban legend, from a joke played on an old chuck wagon sign. (Enid is, after all, “Dine” spelled backward.) The jets from Vance Air Force Base fly so low that residents like to say they can read the markings on the bottoms of the aircraft. Several residents said they now depended on the newspaper’s competitor, The Enid Buzz  —   an online and social media hub for community news and activities  —   for their local news, and they disputed any suggestion that canceling subscriptions was too strong a reaction. “I’m unhappy with the whole media,” said Jody Traynor, 67, a   subscriber who stopped taking the paper after the endorsement. “All of them. They lean too much. They’re supposed to just tell me the news and let me decide. ” All 77 counties in Oklahoma went for Mr. Trump. The last Democrat to carry the state was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, while the last one to carry an Oklahoma county in a presidential election was Al Gore in 2000. Still, there are Democrats in Enid, at least one of whom was pleased with the situation. “We gained one subscriber out of the endorsement editorial,” Mr. Funk said. “We lost 162, but we gained one. ” At Western Sizzlin that Sunday, Mr. Mullin ended up ordering a   steak and a baked potato without further incident, but the confrontation disturbed and puzzled him. He and his wife attend Willow View United Methodist Church, as do members of the man’s family. “Looking back on it, I think it was all talk, but at the time I thought there was a possibility that he might take a swing at me,” said Mr. Mullin, a member of the editorial board. “And I thought this is crazy. This is a newspaper endorsement. Some of the people almost seemed hurt. Like, ‘How can my newspaper’  —   in a small town like this, it’s their newspaper  —   ‘do this to me?’ I think there was almost a sense of betrayal. ”\n",

            "Message: The housing boom is here to stay The housing boom isn’t a fluke. Home prices rose across the country in October, extending gains beyond the 2006 peak for the second month in a row, according to new data released Tuesday. Buyers shelled out 0. 2 percent more for homes across the US in October than September, bringing national prices to a new   high, according to the S&P CoreLogic   index, a barometer of the overall US housing market. While prices went up nationally, home prices eased in five of the 20 cities  —   including New York  —   though some of those changes were seasonal, according to the data. The second straight month of   highs is a sign that home buyers will continue to shell out more for homes, Dr. Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, told The Post. “I don’t foresee home prices dropping anytime soon, at least not nationally,” she said. The data released Tuesday were collected through Oct. 30 and don’t reflect any home buying since the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs earlier this month. For the second time in nine years, the central bank made it more expensive to borrow money by 0. 25 percent. Markets have also pushed up   mortgage rates to about 4. 28 percent  —   or about $2, 468 on a $500, 000 mortgage. That’s up by about $100 a month from a year ago. There’s certainly room for more buyers to enter the market. The home ownership rate is hovering near a   low of 65. 5 percent, up only slightly from an   low during the second quarter of this year, according to US census data. There could be a “Trump boom” coming in housing prices, Robert Shiller, who helped design the price index, told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday.\n",

            "Message: Pau Gasol: ’Zika Is a Much Bigger and More Serious Threat Than We Think’  Spanish basketball star Pau Gasol may skip the Rio Summer Olympics over Zika concerns. [“From my conversations with both US and Spanish experts, my conclusion is that Zika is a much bigger and more serious threat than we think,” the   Olympic silver medalist writes in El Pais. “We know very little and we aren’t as worried as we should be. ”  The Chicago Bulls big told the Associated Press that he may skip the games due to Zika but remains undecided. Golfers Marc Leishman and Vijay Singh cited Zika in opting to stay home. But the winnings in Rio look slim by PGA standards, so financial considerations may play a role as well. Gasol, a   NBA     NBA champion, and past NBA Rookie of the Year, would become the first medalist and household name —  at least in households that watch ESPN instead of CNN —  to boycott the games specifically over Zika concerns. Gasol writes: Our lack of knowledge about the virus is almost total: obviously, we know about the terrible damage it causes to fetuses: the photographs of recently born babies with microcephaly are deeply moving. But that is all the general public knows about it. Few people know that it can lead to the   syndrome, which provokes temporary paralysis and can be deadly. Few know that it is possible to be infected without showing any symptoms, given that this is the case with four out of five infected people, or that the virus is transmitted sexually, even months after being infected. This has all been documented by the WHO, the CDC, the New England Journal of Medicine and other publications and organizations, none of which leave any doubt about the threat it poses. I would recommend reading the WHO’s website about Zika. Though major stars such as American soccer players Alex Morgan and Hope Solo express similar concerns, no major athlete expected in Rio has changed summer plans thus far. More than 100 health experts signed a letter last week demanding that the International Olympic Committee change its plans over holding the games in Brazil this summer. Gasol wonders, “[A]re we taking the precautions that will guarantee the health and safety of fans, athletes and other professionals who will travel to Rio, or are we putting financial concerns above the health of millions of people around the world?”\n",

            "Message: Marijuana grow facility may be forced close because it reeks A marijuana grow operation in Denver could go up in smoke because neighbors are sick of the smell. The grower Starbuds wants to renew its cultivation license, but residents are urging city officials to deny the application  —   complaining that the operation is negatively affecting the neighborhood with its excessive odors,  . Starbuds is located in a   zoning area, but the hearing officer Suzanne A. Fasing says that the operation does not comply with the neighborhood’s restrictions. Fasing has suggested the city revoke its license. But Starbuds argues there is no proof their product reeks. “To take away a license, with the livelihoods of a licensee and its employees at stake, based upon the speculative belief of four witnesses, with absolutely no scientific evidence, is unconscionable,” wrote Jim C. McTurnan, Starbuds attorney,    the neighborhood where the facility is located, enacted a new plan last year, but representatives for Starbuds say there are steps that could be taken for the grower to remain in the neighborhood, such as acquiring more odor neutralization devices. The city’s decision is expected to come as early as the next few days, according to the Denver Post. It would be the first time a Denver grower would lose its license because of resident objection. Colorado was one of the first four states to legalize cannabis for recreational use in 2012. The state saw nearly $1 billion in recreational and medical marijuana sales in 2015,  . It also received $135 million in tax revenue the same year.\n",

            "Message: This week we saw that the Republican Party — not just Trump — is the problem  So much has been written and said about Donald Trump’s manifest unfitness for office that at this point there’s hardly any reason to dwell further on it. But a national convention isn’t just about a single candidate. It’s about an entire political party coming together.    And the truly striking thing about the Republican Mistake By The Lake in Cleveland this summer isn’t the nonsense coming from Trump, his kids, his favorite soap opera actors, and that one avocado farmer  —   it’s the nonsense coming from the Republican Party’s ”establishment.” A broad range of perfectly mainstream Republican Party politicians  —   Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida, and so forth  —   revealed a political party that, completely apart from Trump, is utterly debauched. A rotten party Not everything in American conservatism is toxic, but the convention has revealed a profound and genuinely unusual intellectual and moral rot in the Republican Party: a weakness for outlandish conspiracies and a preference for   antics over the    work of practical politics. Trump is not so much the cause of this rot as the man who simply has the daring to punch the tree and send it tumbling down. The     elected officials and the    delegates who cheered them on did the damage.    Lost in the debate over the propriety of the convention’s loud and lusty ”lock her up” chants, for example, has been insufficient focus on the basic ridiculousness of the argument.    Hillary Clinton’s email server, after all, has already been extensively investigated by a team of FBI agents and federal prosecutors. She’s not going to be locked up because she’s not going to be put on trial because James Comey, a Republican and George W. Bush administration veteran, determined that, given the facts, ”no reasonable prosecutor would file charges.” Under the circumstances, why on earth should she be locked up? Are Comey and the whole FBI in on the  ? Why?    They don’t know and they don’t care to ask. Or they do know and they just don’t care that they’re wrong. Or something. The economy is terrible but Indiana is great In his speech near the beginning of Wednesday’s festivities, Gov. Walker proclaimed that ”liberal Washington insiders created our problems and Hillary Clinton is the ultimate liberal Washington insider.” By contrast, thanks to bold conservative reforms in his home state, ”today more people are employed in Wisconsin than ever before.”    Pence echoed him with the observation that ”for years we’ve had fundamental problems in America that get talked to death in Washington, DC, but they never get solved and they even get worse.” By contrast, thanks to bold conservative reforms in his home state, ”there’s more Hoosiers going to work than ever before.” Here are some fun facts:  Employment is also at an   peak in California  And in New York  And in Minnesota And in New Hampshire And in Washington  As you may have guessed, employment across the United States is at an   high. This is true in states experiencing Republican Party government  —   but also in states experiencing Democratic Party government. The exception to the rule is a handful of states with heavy economic dependence on natural resource extraction who are experiencing a small   due to the current trend of cheap energy which benefits most Americans but harms some communities. Before writing about this I looked these numbers up so I could give an accurate picture of the situation. When Republican governors notice that their state’s economy is doing pretty well, what do they do before making   assertions about the national economy? Do they ask other Republican governors and see that their states are doing well too? Do they then check and see if things are okay in states with Democratic governors? It’s okay to admit that the current labor market situation is decent. The country has plenty of problems. But they don’t know and they don’t care to ask. Or they do know and they just don’t care that they’re wrong. Or something.    A loopy national security policy Nothing circulating in mainstream Republican Party foreign policy is as outright dangerous as their nominee’s views on NATO and the Baltic states. But the common denominator across Trumpkins and establishmentarians is phenomenally stupid. Speaker after speaker after speaker has proclaimed  —   to uproarious applause  —   that we need a leader who isn’t ”afraid” to ”call the enemy by its name: radical Islamic terrorism.” This is fine for the peanut gallery. But knowledgeable experts broadly agree that using this phrase would be counterproductive in terms of America’s relationship with governments in   countries and in terms of the propaganda war in the Islamic world. It’s very understandable that Joe Republican back home doesn’t know this. It’s not really all that understandable that Donald Trump doesn’t get it, but the GOP chose to nominate an uncommonly lazy and ignorant person, so it is what it is. But what’s Chris Christie’s excuse? What’s Pence’s excuse? Walker’s? Did any of them ever actually ask anyone, ”Hey, what is the reason Obama doesn’t say that?” They don’t know and they don’t care to ask. Or they do know and they just don’t care that they’re wrong. Or something.    The party of Trump There is a palpable discomfort with Trump among many of the establishment politicians who are supporting his presidential campaign. Ryan’s speech introducing Pence lavished praise on his character and commitment to conservative ideas that were entirely absent from his main address to the convention. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a rote statement that said electing Trump would be good because it would let senate Republicans govern. Even loopier speeches from elected officials like Christie or Florida Gov. Rick Scott didn’t dwell on making Mexico pay for a wall, banning Muslim immigration, opening up libel laws, abrogating NATO and NAFTA, or other signature Trump themes. But these establishment speeches were, on their own terms, fairly bonkers. Their slams on Clinton veered, repeatedly, into tinfoil hat territory. They were completely out of touch with the state of the economic recovery. They relied heavily on the idea that President Obama could defeat ISIS through rote incantation of magic words. And while they avoided most of Trump’s big crazy policy ideas, they did so mostly by avoiding speaking about any policy ideas at all. The problem wasn’t Trump’s relatives or Scott Baio; it was largely the delegates themselves. Rank and file activists reared on a generation’s worth of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News sat through a pathetic conclave in which governors and senators stooped to   antics in a desperate quest for applause, only to be trounced by Laura Ingraham  —   a real deal talk radio host who, even more than Trump himself, perfectly captured the mood of a party that’s become completely indifferent to the work of governance.     \n",

            "Message: What the holidays are like for a recovering alcoholic like me  ’Twas the night before Christmas, and I really, really wanted a freakin’ drink.    During Christmas dinners past, between courses, you could always find me ducking into my room to hide. I felt incredibly uncomfortable at the table, but I never drank in front of my family  —   my parents knew I had a problem. I usually held tight and counted the minutes before I could escape and meet up with my friends for a drink (or four). As loving as my family is, they have their moments  —   and the holidays seem to bring a lot more of them. Admittedly, most families are like this, which is why none of my friends punch the air and grin as they declare, “Yeah, I’m going home for Thanksgiving!” It’s usually more of a dejected sigh of resignation. Understandably, many of us either drink to get through it or get through it to drink.              This story is republished from Narrative. ly   A few years ago, though, the holidays became different for me. At 22 years old, in November 2011, I decided to get sober for good. The timing wasn’t necessarily intentional. In fact, the timing was horrible; a    feat during that matrix of Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, and everyone’s favorite amateur hour  —   New Year’s Eve. The holidays are the time of year when the child in all of us feels the most temptation to overindulge in, well, just about everything. Throughout college, I was a social drinker who couldn’t stop once I started. I held down an internship and a   job as a reporter while maintaining a 3. 8 GPA throughout all four years of school.   smart, and responsible, I loved that drinking let me throw caution to the wind  —   it was like a reward. It allowed me to go against my better judgment and act “wild and young,” to be really spontaneous. However, if I tried to stop after one or two drinks, I was either a) unsuccessful or b) left with that empty disappointment that lingers when all of the presents have been opened on Christmas morning and it’s only 10 am. Now what?    The sickening realization that I didn’t drink like “normal” people dawned on me slowly, but I didn’t know how to stop without destroying my social life. As a city girl raised on fabulous, bubbly Sunday brunches and packed,   parties, making the decision to stop for good was terrifying.    So I didn’t make the decision. Instead, I did all sorts of things to try to control my drinking. I’ll stop for a month. I’ll just have one. I’ll just have two. Well, I’ll eat a lot, so maybe I can have three. I’ll switch from hard liquor to wine. I’ll only drink at dinner. These worked temporarily, but I always fell right back off the wagon.  I woke up shaking and throwing up more mornings than I can remember. After two, three, then four times in the emergency room for alcohol poisoning, it was clear that it had gone beyond the scope of a harmless social habit. I began to get violent with my boyfriend when I drank, wake up in places I didn’t recognize, and keep my mother up at night worrying where I was (my phone was usually dead or lost). Long story short, I spent Thanksgiving of 2010 hooked up to an IV, hospitalized for alcohol poisoning once again, and it still took me another year to reach out for help.    Why I finally got help It’s no coincidence, of course, that sometime between November and early January, a new slew of   always find their way into substance abuse recovery programs. Many of us were just social drinkers who knew when to say “when,” but couldn’t. The consequences gradually became greater, especially after the “we’re in college” excuse disappeared. In the midst of excuses to overdo it and shattered expectations of the perfect family Christmas, something happened to make us realize that our drinking wasn’t like other people’s, that we were powerless over the compulsion to drink to excess, and that it was starting to make our lives really unmanageable. There wasn’t any one “moment” for me. It wasn’t the overwhelming number of days spent crying and throwing up, holding my head in the agony of a migraine, that forced me to say enough is enough. It wasn’t my  ’s question, “How long are you going to keep doing this to yourself?” It wasn’t the panic attack I had when I realized that in a drunken stupor, I’d left my BlackBerry in a puddle overnight, or the ones I had when I woke up next to a complete stranger.  It was the gradual realization that I had a disease, one that made excessive drinking look like a choice. No sane person endures so much physical and emotional anguish and continues to drink  —   that’s why it’s called a disease. What caused me to throw in the towel was the week in late October 2011 when I managed to get drunk night after night, each one worse than the last, after promising myself  —   pleading with myself  —   that I wouldn’t.    On the   day that I first walked into a   recovery meeting, I was shocked to see that so many young girls were in the same boat as I was. I thought sobriety was for prudes who did nothing interesting with their lives and had no idea what real problems were, but these were stylish women pursuing amazing careers and attending prestigious universities. I was invited to a   party after the meeting; I was just one day sober when I agreed.  The people at this party could have easily been gathered together inside the hottest club West Chelsea has to offer. Not only did they look cool as hell, but they were the happiest crowd of people I’d seen in a long, long time, and the most cheerful I’d ever seen sans alcohol. All of them were in the program  —   some had five years, some five months, others had decades. I stood awkwardly in the doorway clutching a red plastic cup full of seltzer and watching dozens of people laughing, chatting, dancing, and singing, doing everything they normally would have if there had been vodka in the punch. They looked like they were comfortable with themselves. The laughter was real. The friendship was genuine  —   you could feel the warmth and the love radiating out of them  —   and they all had this ease about them that, even at my drunkest, I couldn’t quite cultivate. Best of all, none of them looked like they were dying to escape. “I felt so awkward I wanted to die,” one attendee later told me, laughing. “I didn’t realize how socially anxious I was until I didn’t have a drink in my hand. ” I could relate. That’s how a lot of us feel, but didn’t realize it, because   binge drinking is so normal in our culture. How SantaCon made me glad to be sober Case in point: SantaCon, a Christmas disaster that can only be described as a calamity on 34th Street  —   and every other street in New York City. (Sadly, it’s now also a nationwide epidemic.) College kids (and children of all ages) dress up as Santa or scantily clad Mrs. Claus and take to their city’s bars and restaurants, later spilling out onto the streets, where they continue drinking.     The original idea for SantaCon started off as a very merry concept: People would dress up and parade through the streets spreading goodwill and good cheer, singing Christmas carols, and giving out gifts to strangers. Unfortunately, it has been completely overhauled into an event in which adults act like    kids and hundreds of thousands of people confuse Christmas “spirit” with “spirits. ” I had about 30 days of sobriety under my belt when the SantaCon “parade” took to the streets in 2011. The “SantaConers” start as early as 10 am, and that year, by lunchtime, my Lower Manhattan neighborhood smelled like one big brewery. Last time I checked, walking down the street and drinking from clear plastic cups full of beer was illegal, but it seems to be tolerated on SantaCon day.  By 1 pm, people were urinating in public, passing out in the street, keeling over on the sidewalk, screaming profanities, and throwing up on subways and in parks. My elderly neighbors were pushed and knocked over, and children were shoved aside. Many SantaConers needed to be taken care of, pulled away from a fistfight or carried home, passed out from all the excitement like small children after a wedding. As people dodged   elves and belligerent reindeer running amuck, I heard one little boy ask his father, “Daddy, why are Santa and the reindeer acting like that?” Another little girl hid underneath her mother’s coat, and others literally ran away crying, repeatedly looking back over their shoulders in terror as the crowds gained momentum. As the   pub crawl of   clowns clamored through my neighborhood, all I could think was, “Holy shit, I’m glad that’s not me. ” Not that it would have been me  —   I was more the type to drink in lounges and wine bars than partake in     reveling. I wouldn’t have been caught dead at a pub crawl. Still, as someone who understands the need to take a mini Christmas vacation from reality, I saw something familiar as I looked into the glazed eyes of one slutty Mrs. Claus: the need to get obliterated, and what a mess it looks like when you do. For a long time, I was the one wearing a costume  —   and I wore it all the time. I liked my tiny, boozy escape from reality, a carefree feeling I’d chase and chase as it slipped right through my hands. I couldn’t get enough when I drank: more, more, more. I kept chasing that warm feeling I got when I hit that perfect level between tipsy and drunk  —   but I just couldn’t stop there. As a result, I ended up sick, ashamed, absent, or blacked out more times than I can recall.    Seeing how disgusting SantaCon was affirmed my commitment to never drink again. However, I had to admit that the tamer members of the bunch looked like they were having a great time, and that triggered something I had struggled with my whole life: fear of missing out. Such a feeling was an evil Grinch that presented itself whenever something was going on without my involvement. The Grinch pointed a big hairy finger directly at my fear of what other people thought of me, whether I looked popular, cool, or pretty enough. I had so little confidence in myself that I put all of the value on the external. Watching them parade by, erupting in laughter, I heard my aunt’s enabling voice in the back of my head: “You’re young; you’re supposed to go out and have fun,” she would say. “When I was your age, I had a thousand friends and we went out every weekend. This is your time. ” My aunt was a party girl at my age  —   think Studio 54  —   who knew all of the right people and was out every night. She’s still a party girl now. She lives on the Upper East Side with my uncle, and I would see her and speak to her often. So I regularly found myself on the defensive, bracing for questions about what I’d been doing and whom I was dating. I was especially careful not to divulge compromising information that would welcome more unsolicited opinions. But of course, then there was the big Kahuna. The most challenging night of the season for me was not SantaCon but Christmas dinner with my relatives  —   every single one of them. My first sober Christmas was challenging  —   but my new friends helped me through it Throughout the day, my mind replayed old tapes of Christmases past, churning up anxiety and forming negative expectations that created a nice big bubble of dread in the pit of my stomach. The criticism, the judgment, the   yet unsolicited advice salted the wounds of my own insecurities, and last year was no different.    “Are you going to any parties?” my aunt asked as she spooned her baked ziti onto my plate. (She knows I don’t eat pasta.) “Yes,” I said, my voice cracking with hesitation. “There’s a party at this girl’s house. ” “What kind of party? Is it on the Lower East Side? Where are the cool people going these days?” In hindsight, I see that telling her it was a sober party was a mistake. I know that now. “What are you going to do, have no life anymore?” she cried in response. “Those people are lame. Go do something fun. Live it up!” Fortunately, I had been given one of my gifts early: nearly 20 new numbers in my phone, all belonging to friends and other women in my support network who would listen, laugh, and help me feel true relief. Calling in their support was more comforting than any amount of Baileys. After my aunt’s comment, I furiously texted Allie, who reassured me, “Soon, you and I are going to be able to go anywhere and do anything we want, living lives fuller than we ever could have imagined. ”    “This is a very short period of time,” Allie said, “that we are using to get ready for the best years of our lives. ” Throughout the night, I surreptitiously and periodically backed away into my room, but this time not alone; I reached out to girls who knew how to turn off the valve that began steaming inside me when my uncle raised his voice. When that happened, my friend Claire and I ran through a list of what I was grateful for. “It’s easy to see what’s wrong and get annoyed, but it takes practice to start learning how to see the good in people and in each situation,” she said. Perhaps even more useful  —   for many of us  —   is the advice that Phoebe, another friend from my recovery group, gave me: “Hum a little tune and pretend that you’re watching and listening to someone else’s family. ” Learning to be patient and to accept my family as they are, instead of how I wish they would be, took time. They’re human, I realized eventually  —   fallible and flawed, just like me, just like all of us. When I stopped expecting them to be anything else, I started seeing the best in them, which wasn’t hard once I had the right lenses on. Eventually, I was able to stay present, no longer jumping out of my skin or champing at the bit to escape their clutches and flee the situation. Despite temptation, I continued making my own transition to adulthood, gripping reality tightly even when I wanted to let go through hot toddies and spiked cider.    My first sober New Year’s Eve, my favorite midnight kiss didn’t take place on a   dance floor as champagne rained down from above. I was sprawled on my bed, sober, getting smooches from my  ’s dog, Nayla. I was finally growing up, facing my choices, and moving through the stress of uncomfortable family dinners and social situations without picking up a drink. I can’t say I miss the taste of alcohol, because I always shot it back like medicine, hating the flavor of booze but loving the effect. I’ll admit there are days I wish I could drink up a bit of that warm, fuzzy feeling of relaxation to take the edge off, but the   is more than worth it. I’ve found what Allie said to hold true: I can go anywhere and have a good time, and I never feel like I’m being shortchanged just because I’m not drinking. Now my nights are filled with authentic laughter and fun, sometimes at a “normal” party, sometimes at a sober one, sometimes at a dinner party full of drinkers. Regardless, I know for sure that I’m definitely not missing out on anything. As for the holidays this year, I am incredibly grateful for a family that, despite their kinks, loves each other unconditionally. For the record, I’m far from a prohibitionist. If you can hold your liquor, by all means, go ahead. I toast you with my   eggnog! Peace of mind, I now know, is what I’d been looking for all along  —   I just never thought I could achieve it, ever, let alone without a bottle of wine to create the false, quickly fading feeling for me. The realization that I finally know what real peace and happiness feel like  —   well, that’s a very merry feeling.

            "Message: Doping has always been part of the Olympics. Of course Russia got off the hook.          When the International Olympic Committee announced last weekend that it would not ban the entire Russian Olympic team from next month’s Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro over allegations of systemic doping, the U. S.   Agency’s chief executive, Travis Tygart, called the ruling a “blow to the rights of clean athletes. ” Tygart is correct: The IOC missed an opportunity to punish nations that put national pride before clean sport. But Olympic organizers’ reluctance to   the Russians is only the latest chapter in a relatively new campaign to change an   culture that has always enlisted chemistry  —   both to push the boundaries of human performance and to broadcast the potency of  . When Russians take the field in Rio, they will parade not only   corruption but also the difficulty of imposing   order on sports. The World   Agency strives to preserve what it calls “the spirit of sport”  —   an athletic “celebration of the human spirit, body and mind. ” The brainchild of Olympics founder Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the original spirit of sport was a defense against class revolutions taking place after the Industrial Revolution. The first Olympic Games, in 1896, were conceived as a sanctuary for gentleman amateurs, a “religion with its church, dogmas, service,” Coubertin enthused. Until 1988, pro athletes  —   inherently inferior in aristocratic eyes  —   were barred from the Olympics. It turns out, though, that if there is an essence of elite and professional sports, it is enlisting technology to expand the limits of the human body . (That, and entertaining fans in the interest of making money.) Professional sports are a child of the Industrial Revolution. When immigrant textile laborers in England formed Manchester United in 1878 and munitions workers joined as the Arsenal Football Club in 1886, promoters cashed in selling tickets to their matches, and to other spectacles such as   bicycle races at Madison Square Garden.   sports including cycling,   walking and running were spiritual brethren to milling steel or extracting coal. The public had no more reason to judge a cyclist who used stimulants than a mineworker who made nicotine an essential part of his workday.   [We should host the Olympics in the same place every time]   After   runner Charles Hicks won the 1904 Olympic marathon with the help of brandy and strychnine, physician and Olympic chronicler Charles Lucas wrote that Hicks was “kept in mechanical action by the use of drugs, that he might bring to America the Marathon honors. ” Lucas added that Hicks’s success showed that “drugs are of much benefit to athletes along the road. ” That nonjudgmental attitude carried on for decades. In 1941, influential American exercise physiologist Peter Karpovich observed in a medical journal that “the use of a substance or device which improves the physical performance of a man without being injurious to his health, can hardly be called unethical. ” Drugs began their transition from athlete trade tool to instrument of moral decay in 1960, when Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen died at the Rome Olympics. Competing in a   race without water on a scorching day, Jensen collapsed, hit his bare head and broiled in an uncooled tent for two hours before dying. Though his autopsy reported only heat stroke, news stories based on unfounded rumors made amphetamines into the killer. Like the millions in 1960 who swallowed stimulants to brighten their mood, lose weight or get a job done, cyclists had been happily using speed since it became commercially available as Benzedrine in 1937. But Jensen’s death helped precipitate the first European medical conferences on drugs in sports in the early 1960s. Reacting to better understanding of amphetamine addiction, media hysteria and countercultural social anxieties, the IOC introduced drug tests at the 1968 Winter Games. Even before that, crude nationalism had also hijacked what Coubertin called his pure and “glittering dream of ancient Olympism. ” Hitler used the 1936 Berlin Games as a propaganda spectacle to prove that Germany was great again. Later, the Cold War brought sporting nationalism to a new level. In 1945, Pravda announced 80   sport schools where Soviet athletes would assert the superiority of the communist system. Commenting on his native country’s preparations for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Russian sportswriter Yevgeny Rubin noted in the New York Times that Olympic victories were “one of the   guns of the propaganda arsenal. ”   [Why democracies don’t want the Olympics anymore]   Alarmed, in 1955, future IOC president Avery Brundage warned Saturday Evening Post readers that Americans had become “a race of grandstand and bleacher sitters. ” Unless it got its Olympic act together, the United States was “doomed to a secondary position in the world of sports. ” Brundage was right. In Melbourne in 1956, the Soviets won 98 medals to the Americans’ 74. A year later, the U. S. S. R. launched Sputnik. When the Soviets pulverized an American hoops squad at the 1959 world amateur basketball championships in Chile, a Santiago paper mocked, “When it comes to shooting at the moon or at a basket, the United States cannot keep up with Russia. ” Meanwhile, in   East Germany, Olympians benefited from the   resources of some 1, 500 researchers, 1, 000 doctors and 4, 700 coaches. As one East German doctor told the New York Times in 1976, athletes were supported “just like mission control when an astronaut is sent into space. ” Geopolitics, it turned out, trumped concerns about doping: The mission included anabolic steroids. Though physicians had been aware of steroid health risks since the 1960s, the IOC did not ban the synthetic hormones until testing became available for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. To foil these new   efforts, in 1977, East Germany built an   drug lab in Kreischa, where athletes were tested to ensure they were clean before competing abroad. The lab helped   athletes in two ways: They made sure   drugs were out of their system before leaving the country, and because it also tested samples from outside East Germany, it gave them a sense of how other nations were doping. Documentation revealed after the collapse of East Germany showed that some 3, 000 Stasi police agents made sure that neither physicians nor athletes resisted annual administration of 2 million doses of steroids, even when those drugs had devastating effects. The lab also gave Soviet doctors warning when their dosing triggered positives in Russian athletes. It was a model for the use of government resources and IOC cooperation to tilt the sporting odds. The United States noticed. U. S. weightlifter Bill Starr told Sports Illustrated in 1969 that American athletes “are usually a long way behind the Russians in drug use. ” The 23 athletes who tested positive at the 1976 U. S. Olympic track and field trials suggested that without either a formal pharmaceutical program to measure doses or a test facility devoted to making sure no one was caught, American doping was, indeed, an ad hoc mess. The communist athletic space race delivered. At the 1960 Rome Olympics, the U. S. S. R. took home 103 medals to 71 for the United States. In Munich in 1972, the Soviets bagged 50 gold medals to the Yanks’ 33. At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, the U. S. S. R. and East Germany took 215 medals to the United States’ 94. Congress responded with the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, a law that assigned all Olympic organizing authority to the U. S. Olympic Committee. The act paid for the country’s newly focused Olympic efforts by granting the USOC the right to license the Olympic symbols to corporations. This financial structure created tension between sponsors who used the Olympics to polish their brands and an increasingly aggressive   bureaucracy whose actions scandalized athletes and fans. The growing   forces exercised their clout at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, where   machines popped 15 competitors. Word of the positives sent 12 American track and field athletes packing before ever putting a spike on the track. Wanting to avoid similar awkwardness at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, the USOC screened U. S. athletes at UCLA’s lab before the Games. Because the tests were informational and not official, of the 86 Americans who were positive, only two were denied spots on the Olympic team. During the final week of the Games, some 20 medal winners, many from track and field disciplines, tested positive. When a document linking athletes’ names to the urine samples mysteriously disappeared from an IOC hotel room, the doped victors kept their medals. In 1999, IOC scientist Arnold Beckett told the BBC that the Olympic committee was making a show of “trying to prevent drug misuse in sport. But please don’t get too many positives, which will tend to damage the image of sport. ” IOC medical director Alexandre de Merode said he was reluctant to speak about the 1984 scandal because “it would perhaps destroy credibility. ” These days, financial concerns, not Cold War posturing, counterbalance attitudes about doping. Ever since the 1984 L. A. Games  —   forced by a local ballot measure that denied the organizers any public funding  —   showed how much cash the Olympics could generate from television rights and sponsorships, the IOC has left behind Coubertin’s moldering warnings about the “serious dangers” of mixing sports with moneymaking and turned the Olympics into a commercial extravaganza. Pro athletes are welcome, and today it costs upward of $200 million to become an official Olympic partner. That money comes with a license for corporations to drape their brand in youthful possibility, human achievement and global unity. Admitting that an entire country  —   in this case, Russia  —   blithely flouts all the doping rules would undermine this commercial contract by defiling the sanctifying myth of Olympic purity. It would also expose the IOC to enormously costly legal liability. World   Agency studies indicate that testing snares less than 2 percent of doped athletes. Changing sports’ enduring chemical traditions is hard compared with kicking doping scandals down the road to independent sport federations, as the IOC just did with the Russians. Sending all Russians packing from Rio would have relayed a comforting message that sports can be an island of chemical and moral purity, and that we might someday return to Coubertin’s fantasy of fair play. Ultimately, though, that the IOC instead steamrolled the World   Agency and gave Russia a pass is no surprise. Commercial and geopolitical interests are still stronger than the moral reductionism of   missionaries.\n",

            "Message: Texas Health Officials Brace for More Zika Virus Cases After Six Confirmed Statewide The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) confirmed six   cases of Zika virus in the state, as of late Friday, with four more cases suspected. Public health officials and medical providers are bracing for more cases, worried this could be the tip of the iceberg. [On Friday, Houston public health officials confirmed five Zika virus cases. Dr. Brian Arenare, Director of Disease Control and Clinical Prevention for Harris County Public Health and Environmental Sciences, commented on the challenges of formulating a preparedness plan for a virus with limited published scientific data, according to the Houston Chronicle. He said: “We’re faced with, before the bona fide mosquito season actually begins, having this important opportunity to plan what kinds of steps need to be in place now, so that we’re as far ahead of the curve as we can be. ”  So far, all Texans with confirmed cases of Zika contracted the virus abroad and were diagnosed when they returned stateside says the state health agency. However, Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, believes the Texas Gulf Coast could be “hardest hit” in a Zika outbreak, he told the Houston newspaper. The virus is carried by same two types of Aedes mosquitoes that carry Dengue fever, prevalent on the   border, and Chikungunya, which first entered the state in 2014, with more cases last year, Breitbart Texas reported. These mosquitoes like to reproduce in standing water close to humans. Hotez cited Houston’s economically depressed areas as prime breeding grounds. In North Texas, Dallas County health officials want to better prepare themselves in case of an outbreak by asking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for approval to locally test in May, the start of mosquito season in the region when the virus could spread. On Jan. 26, Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Zachary Thompson told NBC DFW (KXAS) that the county is “taking the proactive step of seeking certification of our lab so that we can be able to do the test locally” and hopes the CDC will approve local testing by May. Presently, Dallas County sends suspect blood samples to   CDC for testing. Dallas last faced a serious health threat in 2014 when a Liberian man, infected with the highly contagious Ebola virus, brought the first case of the deadly illness into the U. S. through Dallas, which Breitbart Texas covered extensively. It spread to two nurses treating the man. He later died, sparking a panic across the   Worth metropolitan area, which remained on edge for months. Breitbart Texas’ Lana Shadwick reported on Saturday that Bexar County health officials in San Antonio confirmed they tested six people for Zika virus, none of them were pregnant. They await results from the CDC.  The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District does not want Bexar County residents to panic since there are no confirmed cases of native Texas mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus, which, according to Dr. Anil Magla, means that the virus is not spreading locally, and only exists in   cases to affected regions. Dr. Nikos Vasilakis is among the world’s leading experts on   illnesses at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston. His team hopes to eventually develop a Zika virus vaccine. Previously, he called Brazil’s   cases in 2015 “the tip of the iceberg. ” He told   affiliate KHOU 11: “We need to find a way to control the spread. ” Vasilakis fears U. S. government regulations could impede the process of developing a general population vaccine. He told the BBC: “What would take the longest time would be the process of passing it through the FDA and other regulatory agencies to allow it for public use and that may take up to 10 to 12 years. ” Breitbart News reported that medical experts warn the virus has “explosive” pandemic potential. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that up to four million cases of Zika may surface before a cure is found. Of greatest concern are pregnant women. Experts suspect a connection between Zika virus and serious birth defects. During Brazil’s 2015 Zika virus outbreak, incidences of microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with small heads and abnormally deformed brains, increased. The CDC advised pregnant women to avoid traveling to the 24 countries seeing high rates of the virus in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands. Cases of   syndrome, a rare paralysis disease, also increased during the 2014 French Polynesia Zika virus outbreak. Wednesday, the CDC suggested that Zika may lead to hearing and vision problems. For now, the best way to combat the virus and avoid an outbreak is to eradicate mosquitoes by removing tires, plastic containers and other refuse from properties that can hold water and where   mosquitos can breed, NBC DFW reported. Texas health officials also recommend wearing long sleeves, covering up, and using insect repellent. TDSHS advises to stay and sleep in   or   rooms and they encourage people, especially pregnant women, to follow the CDC’s travel precautions. TDSHS says that most people exposed to the   illness, experience mild to no symptoms. The signs of the Zika virus are fever, rash, muscle and joint aches and even, pinkeye.

            "Message: Cruz: Trump Attacked My Wife Because He’s ’Scared’  On “Fox News Sunday,” Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said his rival Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is attacking his wife Heidi Cruz, because he is “scared. ”  Cruz said, “Sadly, what Donald has done, when he gets scared, listen, particularly on foreign policy, Donald doesn’t know. He doesn’t understand these issues. One of the reasons he was so scared this week is this past week Donald called publicly for effectively withdrawing America from NATO. Now that is a catastrophically foolish proposition. Abandoning Europe, withdrawing from the most successful military alliance of modern times makes no sense at all. If Donald were president, he actually did what he said he would do, withdraw from NATO. It would hand a massive victory to Putin, a massive victory to ISIS. ISIS would be dancing in the street at the weakness and isolation of Donald Trump. ” “Now the day after he calls for withdrawing from NATO, this Brussels terror attack occurs. Brussels, is of course, where NATO is head quartered,” he continued. “So his lack of understanding on foreign policy, his lack of ability and readiness to protect his country was evident. So Donald did what he always he tried to find a way to change the subject. He hasn’t campaigned for a week. He’s been hiding in Trump Tower. late at night he sends tweets attacking my wife, attacking Heidi. It is inappropriate, wrong and disgusting to see a candidate attacking the spouse of another. And it is a sign of just how scared Donald is right now because he doesn’t want to discuss the substance. That’s why he’s afraid to debate, why he refuses to debate because when he debates, his lack of understanding of the challenge of facing America becomes evident for everyone to see. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n",

            "Message: Canada says most border-crossing asylum seekers were in U.S. legally  Most of the people crossing the U. S. border into Canada to claim asylum had been in the United States legally, and Canada is sharing their information with U. S. authorities to help understand the phenomenon, a top official said on Friday. Several hundred asylum seekers, mainly from Africa but also the Middle East, have entered Canada. The refugees and migrant agencies blame the exodus on moves by U. S. President Donald Trump to clamp down on immigration.  ”We have provided information about the specific documents that were presented at the border because those are American documents,” Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters. Goodale spoke after meeting U. S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly in Ottawa for talks on the influx, which is putting domestic pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Emergency responders and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are struggling to respond to people defying wintry conditions to cross the undefended border near Emerson, Manitoba. Manitoba premier Brian Pallister is demanding Trudeau’s Liberal government provide money and resources. Ottawa says there is a chance the flow of people will increase as the weather improves. ”We obviously have safety concerns on both sides of the border,” Goodale said, adding that he had seen no evidence yet of any profiteering or human trafficking. Kelly told CTV that he and his Canadian counterparts were ”perplexed as to why people who generally, as a group, have come to the United States legally” would make their way north. Canadian officials caution against the idea that Trump’s policies are solely to blame. Goodale said some of the asylum seekers had been planning their move in early 2016, months before the November election that brought Trump to power. Goodale said there was little Canada could do, since the ”vast majority” of those crossing the border had been in the United States legally and enjoyed freedom of movement. ”No one is suggesting the construction of a wall along the Canadian border, no one is saying the RCMP should line up along the border and join arms and shoo people away,” he said. Goodale said he and Kelly had agreed officials needed to gather more information to work out what was happening. Factors to look at, he said, included ”who are the people involved in this migration, where did their journey begin . .. (and) how is the migration being accomplished?”  (Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by James Dalgleish) DOHA Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbors, but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement.     forces edged into the final redoubts of the two capitals of Islamic State’s   caliphate in Iraq and Syria on Tuesday, hampered by fierce resistance from the militants and the presence of human shields. \n",

            "Message: LGBT employees protected from workplace discrimination, appeals court rules  (CNN) The Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination against LGBT employees, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. ”We conclude today that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination,” Judge Diane Wood wrote for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.  The ruling is a victory for Kimberly Hively, who sued Ivy Tech Community College, arguing that the school violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it denied her employment. ”Any discomfort, disapproval, or job decision based on the fact that the complainant    woman or man    dresses differently, speaks differently, or dates or marries a   partner, is a reaction purely and simply based on sex,” Wood wrote.  ”That means that it falls within Title VII’s prohibition against sex discrimination, if it affects employment in one of the specified ways,” Wood added. ”This decision is (a)   for lesbian and gay employees facing discrimination in the workplace and sends a clear message to employers: it is against the law to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation,” said Greg Nevins of Lambda Legal, the group that brought the case. Dissent: Sex and orientation are different, Judge Diane Sykes, a top contender for the Supreme Court under President Donald Trump, wrote the dissent for three members of the court, calling the majority opinion ”momentous”. She said that if Hively was denied a job because of her sexual orientation, she was ”treated unjustly.” ”But Title VII does not provide a remedy for this kind of discrimination. The argument that it should must be addressed to Congress,” Sykes wrote. She said that classifying people by sexual orientation is ”different” than classifying them by sex. ”The two traits are categorically distinct and widely recognized as such,” she said. Next stop, Supreme Court? ”Federal   laws were always going to be the next battleground after the Supreme Court’s gay marriage decision,” said Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the University of Texas and CNN legal analyst. ”And in some respect, these laws are even more important, because they also apply to private parties    such as employers.” Tuesday’s ruling conflicts with a different appellate court ruling    in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals    from last month that found that Title VII does not bar claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation, possibly teeing the issue up for Supreme Court review.

            "Message: Outgoing US ambassador: America is ’not an ethno-state’  (CNN) An outgoing career ambassador urged his colleagues on Friday to defend the   world order in which the US supports a Europe ”whole, free and at peace,” a thinly veiled critique of the Trump administration, which has questioned the importance of the transatlantic alliance. Ambassador Daniel Fried, the outgoing coordinator for sanctions policy, did not mention President Donald Trump or speak directly to his policies, but the State Department officials present understood his meaning when he said ”we are not an   with identity rooted in shared blood.” ”The option of a white man’s republic ended at Appomattox,” he said in a farewell address at the State Department, referencing the 1865 battle that led to the surrender of the Confederate army and ended the Civil war. Hundreds of foreign and civil service officers and current and former White House and Treasury officials gathered Tuesday to bid farewell to Fried, whose Foreign Service career spanned 40 years and seven presidencies. His comments came amid widespread concerns about Trump’s policy toward Russia and what many see as contradictory messages from Washington regarding the future relationship between the US and Europe, including whether America will support the continuation of the European Union.   ”Nothing can be taken for granted, and this great achievement is now under assault by Russia,” Fried said, referring to the freedom and security of Europe. ”It is for the present generation to defend and, when the time comes again, extend freedom in Europe.” Acting Deputy Secretary of State Tom Shannon called Fried a ”national treasure” for his work to help advance freedom and security in Central and Eastern Europe throughout the Cold War and after the fall of the Soviet Union. He served as US ambassador to Poland and director for European affairs at the National Security Council before becoming the assistant secretary for Europe at the State Department.  In recent years Fried took on some of the most thankless tasks of US diplomacy    lobbying countries to take in Guantanamo detainees who were released from captivity and coordinating sanctions policy against North Korea over its nuclear program and against Russia over its actions in Ukraine.  Fried’s departure leaves another hole in the State Department’s senior ranks, with most career ambassadors having already being asked to leave or choosing to retire rather than work for the Trump administration.\n",

Further, ”states cannot   impose additional restrictions on eligibility to serve in   Congress,” Chemerinsky said, meaning Montana could not enact   legislation to bar him from serving in light of the alleged   offense. ’ ’   William Banks, Professor of Public Administration and   International Affairs at Syracuse University agreed, but further   clarified the terms. ’ ’’ ’   Banks told Business Insider the US Constitution does not stop ”a   convicted member of Congress from continuing to serve, even for   felony convictions, short of treason.” The only barrier Gianforte   could face is if he is jailed for a term of two or more years.   The charge he is facing in Montana, however, is punishable by up   to six months in jail. ’ ’   But if that were to happen, House regulations would bar Gianforte   from participating in votes. If that were the case, he could   potentially ”lose committee ranking or chair positions under   party rules,” Banks said. However, it is unlikely for Gianforte   to be sentenced to two or more years in prison for a misdemeanor   assault, so those terms likely wouldn’’t apply. ’ ’   A   scenario for Gianforte would be being expelled from   the House, which the House could do, following a   vote.   However, Dr. Jon Michaels, a law professor at UCLA, told Business   Insider the   vote has happened ”incredibly   infrequently,” and ”mostly around the Civil War and surrounding   questions of loyalty to the Union.” ’ ’   Gianforte is expected to appear in Montana court by June 7th. ’ ’A day after Montana Republican Greg Gianforte. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’\n",

            "Message: What next for Maria Sharapova as she prepares to appeal against her drug ban? Maria Sharapova will not be at Wimbledon this month, nor will she be at peace with herself for a little while yet, because the battle the Russian has chosen to join in pursuit of clearing her name as a drug cheat will drag on well into the summer. Her lawyer, John Haggerty, reiterated to the Guardian on Thursday night that he was confident they had enough “wriggle room” to put a strong case for acquittal or a reduction of her   ban to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) in Switzerland, which he estimates is not expected to sit before the end of next month. That would, of course, rule out her attendance at Wimbledon, which starts on 27 June, even though she is a lifetime guest and member, having won the title in 2004  —   because, as a tournament source said: “She would be not be allowed on site because the conditions of a ban forbids access to a tournament venue. ” Haggerty accepted that, and said his client’s focus is on her appeal, adding: “I’m a little disappointed the International Tennis Federation’s tribunal [which sat for two days in London last month] did not take into account some of the evidence we presented. ” He focused on four paragraphs of its findings, but mainly No63, centring on her admission she took the drug Mildronate (meldonium)  —   legal until banned on 1 January  —   for 10 years, but for a time alongside two others she did not declare, magnerot and roboxin. “All of them were legal,” Haggerty said, “and she did not have to declare them. But she was not hiding anything by so doing. ” However, while one jury has convicted Sharapova on the evidence provided by her own admission and further examination of the five matches she played at the Australian Open in January, another set of adjudicators  —   the amorphous corporate beast whose money has made her the richest woman in sport, and clings tenuously to an   morality  —   is divided still on the Russian’s guilt. After her   banishment was announced on Wednesday afternoon  —   this time by the ITF, instead of the player herself, who stole its thunder with her televised confession in March  —   Sharapova’s seven   financial backers delivered their   verdicts like this on Thursday. IN: Nike, back in the fold after dumping her in March, when she confessed to failing a drug test after losing to Serena Williams in the   of the Australian Open in January her racket provider, Head, which has remained faithful throughout, to the displeasure of its other star client, Andy Murray her   water sponsor, Evian and Supergoo, a skincare company, which will support her through to the appeal, and make a definitive call then. OUT: Porsche, which drove into the sunset when she confessed, is keeping its options open until the result of her appeal to the court of arbitration for sport the cosmetic giant Avon, which fudged its call by saying its deal was “set to expire” Tag Heuer, taking Swiss neutrality to its logical conclusion, has not renewed its   contract, which expired last year, but is keeping its options open. The World   Agency, which prosecuted the case against her, is still reviewing the judgment and has yet to decide whether or not to appeal against the length of the ban. “We have 21 days to decide whether or not we want to appeal to Cas, either after we have received the full case decision or after any other party has appealed, the later of those two scenarios,” the Wada spokesman Ben Nichols said. “We can appeal the decision given by the organisation, in this case the ITF, or we can   if an athlete makes an appeal and we don’t agree with that line of thinking. ” He added: “That’s where we are, and we don’t have an affirmative on which way we’ll go. We look at these cases as a matter of course and then we take a position. ” All of which gives the impression of a cessation of hostilities while all sides rearm. Meanwhile, fans remain confused by a verdict that on the one hand declared Sharapova was guilty but, on the other, not intentionally so  —   allowing the handing down of a   rather than a   sentence, on a procedural technicality. It gave the impression, however, that the   panel had lost its collective nerve. The mixed message  —   a probationary order rather than a life sentence  —   gave the player heart as well. She struck a combative pose when she said: “The tribunal, whose members were selected by the ITF, agreed that I did not do anything intentionally wrong, yet they seek to keep me from playing tennis for two years. ” At the Cas appeal she will choose one of the three arbitrators, with the ITF selecting another, and the third neutral. “And that gives us cause to be confident, too,” Haggerty said. How will they call it? History suggests they will be kind to her. In 2013, they cut Viktor Troicki’s ban for refusing to submit a blood sample from 18 months to a year and Marin Cilic had a   suspension for unknowingly ingesting a banned stimulant reduced to only four months. Sharapova has tumbled in the rankings from nine to 26, irrelevant in practical terms while she is out of the game, but symbolically significant for her at 29 and with only a slim chance of returning to the game before the 2018 French Open. And, when this lousy war is over, she might reflect on a curiosity largely overlooked in all of this: she could beat Serena Williams when “clean” of meldonium  —   for that Wimbledon title as a    teenager  —   but not in the subsequent 19 matches when she was using it, including the   in Melbourne that might yet prove to be her final appearance on a tennis court.\n",

            "Message: Donald Trump promises to deport 3 million “illegal immigrant criminals.” That’s literally impossible.  If you take   Donald Trump at his word, according to what he told 60 Minutes’ Lesley Stahl in his first interview since the election, the overwhelming majority of unauthorized immigrants in the US have nothing to fear from his administration.     “What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,” he told Stahl. Most unauthorized immigrants don’t have criminal records. If the Trump administration actually limited its deportation efforts to convicted criminals, it would be more lenient than the Obama administration has ever been. The problem is that the   doesn’t understand that. He told Stahl that there are “probably 2 million, it could even be 3 million” unauthorized immigrants with criminal records in the US  —   and that he wanted to deport all of them. The Trump administration isn’t going to be able to deport 2 or 3 million “criminal illegal immigrants,” because there simply aren’t that many people who fit the description. If it wants to deport 2 to 3 million people, it’s going to have to scoop up a lot of people who don’t already have criminal convictions.    Deporting 2 to 3 million immigrants in a single term as president would be something we’ve never seen in America. It would put every unauthorized immigrant in the US under a one in four chance of being separated from family, thrown in jail, or sent back to a country that many of them haven’t set foot in for years.     Take   Trump at his word, and unauthorized immigrants have nothing to fear from him. Look at the implications of his promises, though, and they have everything to fear.  There probably aren’t 2 or 3 million unauthorized immigrants with criminal records in the US  —   and there never has been The reason there’s so much uncertainty about Trump’s plan is that it’s based on a false premise. And when you’re making policy based on a false premise, you end up facing a choice: Stick to the game plan  —   even if it doesn’t get the results you want  —   or do whatever is needed to make it look like you were right all along.    Unsurprisingly, the core of Trump’s argument is a bogus statistic. He’s promising to deport “people who are criminal and have criminal records” who are also “here illegally”  —   and then saying there are “probably 2 million, it could even be 3 million” of such people. The stretch to 3 million is sheer Trumpian exaggeration. But the 2 million is rooted in an official government estimate  —   of something else. In its budget request for the 2013 fiscal year (written in early 2012) the Department of Homeland Security requested extra money to identify and deport immigrants living in the United States who’d been convicted of crimes. It explained the need for the cost by pointing out that the government had never been able to track all “removable criminal aliens”:    ICE estimates that approximately 900, 000 arrests of aliens for crimes occur every year and that approximately 550, 000 criminal aliens convicted of crimes exit law enforcement custody every year. ICE has never had the capability to identify, arrest and remove all of these criminal aliens. ICE estimates that 1. 94 million removable criminal aliens are in the United States today.  This estimate was basically an educated guess  —   and it was based on data that was already a few years old when ICE wrote the report. ICE looked at the number of immigrants in the United States according to the 2008 American Community Survey, looked at a Department of Justice report (with data that ended in 2001) about the number of Americans who’d been in prison, and extrapolated accordingly.          It’s not clear whether there were ever 1. 9 million “removable criminal aliens. ” It’s certainly likely that after eight years of an Obama administration that’s implemented immigration checks in prisons and jails all over the country and deported hundreds of thousands of “criminal aliens,” there are fewer than 1. 9 million left. After all, ICE made that estimate to request more money from Congress to deport these people  —   and the money was granted. And, crucially, it’s not clear how many “removable criminal aliens” are also unauthorized immigrants. Despite what   Trump says, the two are not the same: An immigrant can be “removable” because he’s unauthorized, but he can also become removable once convicted of a crime that strips him of his legal status.  The Trump administration’s first 100 days’ plan promises to start removing “the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country. ” But the population of “criminal illegal immigrants” is a subgroup of the “removable criminal aliens” that ICE once estimated to number 2 million. And who knows how many of those are left.    The Trump administration is getting rid of the policies that focused deportation efforts on criminals Obviously, it matters intrinsically that the   of the United States is building one of his chief administration policy priorities on a statistic that’s essentially a lie. Even if there were 2 million unauthorized immigrants with criminal records in the US, the US government doesn’t know where all of them are. The number of immigrants with criminal records who’ve recently been released from custody amounts to fewer than 200, 000.  Since the Trump administration won’t be able to do what it promises, though, the question becomes what it will do instead. And here’s where things get sticky. If the Trump administration really stuck to deporting or detaining “criminal illegal immigrants”  —   if it didn’t deport any unauthorized immigrant who hadn’t been convicted of a crime  —   it would be more lenient than the Obama administration has ever been toward the unauthorized.  Right now (thanks to a policy that’s been in place since late 2014) ICE agents are instructed to focus on people convicted of crimes, people who’ve entered the US since 2013, and people who already have deportation orders. Taking the Trump administration at its word about “criminal illegal immigrants,” it would only target the first of those.         But the only way to focus resources on a particular group of unauthorized immigrants is to tell immigration agents not to spend their resources on other groups of unauthorized immigrants  —   to tell agents whom they should and shouldn’t deport.  In other words, it requires doing exactly what   Trump has promised not to do: directing immigration agents only to “enforce the law” in particular cases.    Many agents think their job is to apprehend and deport anyone who’s violated immigration law  —   the idea of focusing on people who’ve also broken criminal laws just doesn’t make any sense to them. They’ve been in   rebellion against the Obama administration, and they rallied around a candidate, Donald Trump, who promised to let them do their jobs.   Trump has promised to dismantle the programs that allowed the Obama administration to protect particularly “terrific” immigrants from deportation  —   like the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.  Without another way to tell agents what to do (in a way that forces them to comply) the Trump administration wouldn’t be any more effective than the Obama administration was during its first term, when it told agents to focus on “criminals” but wasn’t able to do anything when agents decided to go after people who were simply here without papers. Deport 2 million people first, label them “criminals” later? Even when there was evidence that immigration agents weren’t just going after convicted criminals, though, President Obama and his White House claimed they were. And the official statistics collected by ICE certainly indicated that at least half of their record numbers of deportees were “criminal aliens. ” Plenty of “criminal aliens,” though, weren’t threats to public safety. Many were just people who’d come into immigration custody through the criminal justice system after being picked up by local police or booked into a local jail. In practice, this created an incentive to engage in racial profiling: Pull over someone who “looks illegal” for a traffic violation, book him for driving without a license, turn him over to immigration agents, tally him up as a “criminal alien. ” The Trump administration has promised to restore the programs that gave local police most power to help enforce immigration law. It’s going to have a lot of unauthorized immigrants come into contact with the criminal justice system  —   most of whom wouldn’t be considered “removable criminal aliens” if you looked at their records today.    It would be very easy for the Trump administration to deport as many people as possible and simply claim it’s doing it because they’re criminals. Immigration agents won’t disagree: Many of them see all unauthorized immigrants as criminals. The public may not know any better. After all, President Trump will say they’re going after criminals. The only people who will know the truth will be immigrants themselves, who will live under the constant fear of detention and deportation  —   and for whom the fact that they aren’t convicted criminals will, they know, be no protection.

            "Message: American democracy is winning... so far  (CNN) On the 100th day of his presidency, Donald Trump again attacked the media and stoked the embers of divisiveness that fueled his election. But on the very same day, Americans    even the majority who disapprove of Trump’s presidency    could find reasons to celebrate. No, Trump has not turned out to be any less inflammatory as a president than he was as a candidate. And it’s far too early to claim the US has averted disaster. But the American people’s reaction to Trump’s election has proven much stronger than anyone expected.  And with the   marker signaling the end of the beginning of his presidency, Americans, and a   world, can take note: America’s system of democracy is strong. It’s strong enough to stand up to a man with visceral authoritarian tendencies and who came to power surrounded by   ideologues vowing to ”deconstruct” the system. As Trump spoke before a large crowd (not an ”  record,” as he claimed) in Pennsylvania, journalists gathered in Washington to highlight the importance of a free press for the survival of democracy.  Trump was the first president to stay away from the White House correspondents’ dinner since 1981, when Ronald Reagan couldn’t attend because he was recovering from an assassination attempt. Reagan sent his regrets.  Trump insulted the press, calling them ”enemies of the people”    a phrase favored by Stalin    in the hopes that people will ignore the news that is not to his liking, including approval ratings that are lower than any modern president’s at this point in his term. Complaining about his failure to achieve very much, Trump also called the American system ”archaic,” or bad for the country.  The reality is rather the opposite. The system is working surprisingly well. From the day he took office, it became clear that Americans who saw Trump as a threat to the country’s fundamental values would not sit home and mope    or run off to hide in Canada. Incensed to see a man who bragged about sexual assault become president, women on Inauguration Day organized marches in every state of the union. And they succeeded, with millions taking to the streets in what may have been the biggest single day of demonstration in US history. That sent a powerful message to Congress and helped energize the nation. By then, Trump’s disdain for the First Amendment, his constant efforts to discredit the media, his blatant efforts to cash in on the presidency, his verbal attacks on refugees and immigrants and his entourage of conspiracy theorists and climate deniers had already sounded the alarm. Many started calling themselves ”the resistance,” a term more commonly used during times of foreign occupation, and a sign that they view Trump not as a president with whom they disagree, but as a genuine and severe threat to the country. Popular resistance to Trump started paying off immediately. When the White House issued an executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim majority countries from entering the country, spontaneous demonstrators swarmed airports across the country. Lawyers with laptops sitting on airport floors drafted legal documents. Attorneys general and state prosecutors filed emergency cases before judges in several states.  Incredibly, Trump’s orders were blocked. The president was furious. And when he rewrote the plan, it was blocked again. The separation of powers worked. Independent judges did their job. The federal system worked. Independent states challenged the federal government. The Constitution worked. The Founding Fathers, who might have been turning in their graves hearing Trump’s multiple verbal assaults on the freedoms they espoused, would have been happy to see their design hold up under fire. A free press has shone a bright light on the Trump team’s secret ties to Russia. Because of journalists, we learned that Mike Flynn, Trump’s dangerous choice for National Security Advisor, lied about meetings with Russian officials and was paid as an agent of Turkey. Trump replaced him with Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, a widely praised addition to a foreign policy team that now includes some   reasonable figures. In the meantime, multiple congressional investigations and an FBI probe are looking into Russia’s involvement in the election and the possible links with Trump’s campaign. The   congressional side of the investigations is far from impressive, but it is occurring. In most countries, this would be unimaginable. The FBI and Congress, investigating a foreign government the president praised repeatedly on the campaign trail and in the early days of his administration, are seemingly open to following the evidence as far as it leads, even if it leads to Trump himself.  But perhaps nothing is more astonishing that Trump’s failure to make progress on most of his signature promises, even though his party controls all three branches of government. The Republicans may have a majority in the House and the Senate, but when Trump tried to pass his promised ”repeal and replace” of Obama’s health care plan, members of his own party balked. The same was true for his idea for a wall on the Mexican border. Trump had absurdly promised to have Mexico pay for the wall. When he asked Congress to approve money for the project, he got nowhere.   That is not to say that Trump’s presidency has been inconsequential. He has already done a great deal of harm. His contempt for facts, his ”gaslighting” techniques    tampering with reality to cast doubt on truth    his embrace of dictators and disregard for human rights around the world have already stained America’s credibility and its cherished position as a champion of democratic values and freedom.  So far, the presidency has proven a difficult and frustrating exercise for Trump. No wonder he said the job is harder than he expected. But it’s early yet. One hundred days still leaves more than 90% of a presidential term. History will record that the Trump presidency was a major test for American democracy and its system of government. The good news is that Americans are actively defending their rights. Democracy is winning. So far.\n",

            "Message: USSS chief says ’No friction’ with Trump’s private security Washingotn (CNN) US Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy wants to set the record straight about   Donald Trump’s private security team and whether it’s causing conflict with his agents. In an exclusive interview with CNN    his first since Trump’s election    Clancy also offered a   look at the unique logistical challenges of providing security for the  ’s large family and securing his New York residence. Most of all, however, he wanted to push back against suggestions that there were conflicts between the Secret Service and the private security team that’s protected Trump for years. Politico reported last month that Trump’s private team ”bristled” at the Secret Service’s desire to take the lead in protecting Trump and in some cases, they had gotten in the way of the agency’s protocols. ”There is no friction at all” with Trump’s private team, insisted Clancy, who said his agency has ”sole responsibility” for protecting the President and the first family. He added that there is no overlap between the private team and his agency. ”They are not in our meetings,” Clancy said. ”They are not armed. They are more of a staff function than a security function. We don’t interact with them.” He explained that while Trump’s private team is there to ensure public events run smoothly and there are no disruptions from the crowd, Secret Service agents are the only ones protecting the  . Although protesters have been a feature of many Trump campaign stops and some have pledged to protest the inauguration, Clancy said that unless a protester is a direct physical threat to the President, the Secret Service will not intervene. ”We want to make sure everyone has their First Amendment rights,” he said, adding that if a protester is removed, that is a decision made by event staff.  Trump has named the head of his private security team, retired NYPD officer Keith Schiller, as his director of Oval Office operations and deputy assistant to the President. Clancy said Schiller serves as a ”conduit for information” between the agents and the   and helps inform the Secret Service about any changes to Trump’s itinerary.  ”He has a larger family. He’s got five children, grandchildren, so that will require more assets, more personnel,” Clancy said. He noted that Trump’s children are ”young adults, so they’re very active, they travel.” But Trump’s Fifth Avenue residence in New York City, Trump Tower    where future First Lady Melania Trump plans to reside through next spring with the couple’s youngest son    presents a different challenge. It’s not unusual for a first lady to be in a different location than the President, Clancy said, but he acknowledged the new Trump arrangement represents a ”longer period of time” than usual    even though his agency would never advise the first family to change their preferred living arrangements.  ”There are enough inconveniences when you take on this role as President and first lady,” Clancy said. ”We don’t want to add to that.”  Trump Tower, The midtown Manhattan building sits on one of the busiest streets in the country. Clancy said the goal is to provide robust security while simultaneously allowing local businesses and residents to continue using the building.  ”We are bringing in more resources” to handle the situation, he said, adding that the Secret Service is working to establish a command post inside Trump Tower that would be ”pretty close to an entire floor.” According to Jared Horowitz, who works for the company responsible for available commercial space at Trump Tower, the floors available to rent    with the average floor space running between 13, 500 to 15, 500 square feet    cost about $1. 5 million a year. Asked about the high price tag, Clancy said they were required by law ”to pay for the property that we need,” adding that the space was ”critical to the protection of the President, so it’s something that needs to be done.”  ”It’s actually no different than what we’ve done with other presidents,” Clancy continued. ”We rented some property in Chicago when President Obama first became president for his trips when he was going out to Chicago. So, this is typically what we do.”  Regarding the government’s negotiations with their new landlord, the Trump Organization, Clancy said, ”They’re very fair with us. They understand the responsibilities we have and they’ve been very accommodating.”               Protecting the President, Clancy, a   veteran of the Secret Service who ran the presidential protection division during the first years of Barack Obama’s presidency, noted there are more similarities than differences among the presidents they protect. ”I don’t think any of them sleep very well,” he said. ”They’re also very  . They all run on tight schedules,” adding that, ”They’re all involved in athletics. Some enjoy golf, some enjoy running, some biking.” In the past year and a half that the Secret Service has been working with Trump, Clancy said he has met with him a couple of times, describing him as ”very gracious and very appreciative” of the Secret Service. Asked how Trump was adjusting to motorcades and having    teams of armed agents guarding him, Clancy said ”it’s unusual for anyone to get used to it, but he has been terrific.”  Threats in the age of Twitter, Two newer areas the Secret Service is focused on are social media and cyberthreats, an area of particular concern given Trump’s frequent use of Twitter and mounting concerns regarding US cybersecurity.  The director said the Secret Service now has a specific division focused on potential social media threats. He also said they are deploying the same experts that provide cyber security for the US financial system in order to ensure that facilities visited by the president are defended from  .  ”Everything keeps me up night,” he said of the array of threats.  But, he added, ”that’s our business.”\n",

            "Message: The simple arithmetic that could jump-start America’s economic growth  Woodrow Wilson, who enjoyed moralizing about the mundane, called paying taxes a “glorious privilege. ” In 1865, when there was a Civil War income tax, one taxpayer shared this sensibility, sort of. Mark Twain said that his tax bill of $36. 82 (including a $3. 12 fine for filing late) made him feel “important” because the government was paying attention to him. Today, Rep. Kevin Brady wants to change the way government pays attention to taxpayers.  Congress is like a Calder mobile: Something jiggled here causes things to wiggle over there. When conservatives toppled House Speaker John Boehner ( ) they inadvertently propelled Brady into the House’s most important chairmanship, that of the Ways and Means Committee. Because revenue bills must originate in the House, Brady now wields Congress’s most important gavel, all because the committee’s previous chairman, Paul Ryan ( .) now sits in Boehner’s chair.

If the Obama era’s average annual growth of 2. 2 percent becomes the “new normal,” over the next 50 years real gross domestic product will grow from today’s $16. 3 trillion (in 2009 dollars) to $48. 3 trillion. If, however, growth averages 3. 2 percent, real GDP in 2065 will be $78. 6 trillion. At 2. 2 percent growth, the cumulative lost wealth would be $521 trillion.  Brady, however, would like to start with the approximately $2 trillion that U. S. corporations have parked overseas. Having already paid taxes on it where it was earned, the corporations sensibly resist having it taxed again by the United States’ corporate tax, the highest in the industrial world. “[The $2 trillion] won’t just naturally fly back to us,” Brady says. Measures should be taken to make it rational for corporations to bring money home. And to make it rational for corporations such as Pfizer, which recently moved its headquarters to Ireland for tax purposes, to remain here.  In the past 30 years, Brady says, more and more taxes have been paid by fewer and fewer people. And fewer and fewer businesses have been organized as corporations:   of   entities are not paying corporate taxes.  “You can’t,” Brady says, “ask people to make big changes, leapfrogging our global competitors, just to get to average. ” But making big changes “is why we all came to Congress. ” And the benefit that comes from something unfortunate  —   the fact that there are so few (perhaps fewer than 40) competitive House seats  —   is that members can take risks. Presidential engagement is necessary for tax reform, and Brady says that will require a new president who understands that “just a little respect goes a long way up here [on Capitol Hill]. ” All Republican presidential candidates have tax reform proposals, but only one candidate proposes increasing the cost of government for every American. Here, at last, Donald Trump actually resembles a Republican. Unfortunately, it is a Republican from 125 years ago, when the party stood for big government serving crony capitalism with high tariffs.  As Steven R. Weisman demonstrates in his splendid history of American taxation, “The Great Tax Wars,” the GOP’s tariffs were indirect, hidden sales taxes that crimped consumption by Americans with small incomes. In 1913, the first year of Wilson’s presidency and the year the 16th Amendment and the income tax arrived, the glorious privilege of paying taxes was enjoyed primarily through tariffs: They provided nearly half of federal revenues, with most of the rest coming from tobacco and liquor taxes, which also were hardest on people of modest means. Trump, who works himself into a lather because Nabisco is making some Oreo cookies outside the country, is obsessed with the United States’ trade with China. “We’re going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country,” he says, aiming to raise the price Americans pay for Apple products that today are assembled in China, which, according to trade attorney Scott Lincicome, makes about $6 by assembling an iPhone from parts (many of which China has imported). Trump favors a 45 percent tariff to protect customers of Walmart and similar retailers from the onslaught of inexpensive Chinese apparel, appliances and food. He can explain the glorious privilege of paying    when he makes his next visit to a Walmart, perhaps the one in Secaucus, N. J. just seven miles from his Fifth Avenue penthouse.

            "Message: Trump and Clinton join mourners at 9/11 anniversary ceremony Getty Images  Gabriella Bass  Getty Images  Getty Images  AP Getty Images  Getty Images  Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images  Getty Images  Getty Images  G. N. Miller View Slideshow Thousands of mourners including Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump gathered at Ground Zero Sunday to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The day of remembrance of one of the darkest days in the nation’s history started with the annual reading of the names of the 2, 977 innocent lives that were taken during the 2001 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and the commercial airliner that crashed in a central Pennsylvania field.  six times throughout the ceremony, starting at 8:46 a. m.  —   the exact time the first plane crashed into the North Tower. The final somber silence was set for 10:28 a. m. when the North Tower crumbled to the ground. Many of the 8, 000 people who were at the ceremony were grieving family members of the victims, including Tom Aquaviva, whose    son Paul was killed in the attack. “15 years means the same thing as 14 years,” he said. “We come every year year, plus some other times. I’m glad there are more people here today because the crowd was getting less and less. ” “People still remember,” he added. “That’s the important thing. ” For others who lost loved ones in the attacks, being at Ground Zero on the milestone anniversary was really the only place they felt comforted. “This is, for   family members, the only place where we are surrounded by all the other families that are going through the same thing, feeling the same things, sharing what only we can share,” said Nancy Shakuri, whose firefighter brother Dennis Scauso was killed. “This is really the place where everybody knows that every name has a person behind it. ” Prior to the morning ceremonies, outgoing Police Commissioner Bill Bratton reminded the NYPD to remember the bravery their colleagues displayed in the minutes, hours and days following the terror attacks. “We cannot forget, and we will not forget  —   partly because of the plaques in too many precincts and the names on too many streets, partly because cops who served and suffered and survived that day still wear the uniform, and not least because officers among us are still dying,” he said in a message to his officers. “It’s good that we don’t forget, because what they did is worth remembering,” Bratton added. Trump arrived around 8:15 a. m. at the North Pool to cheers from the crowd while several families of   victims took out their cellphones to snap a picture of the Republican presidential nominee. Clinton arrived around the same time, but left early and abruptly  —   a few minutes before the 9:58 a. m. moment of silence symbolizing the South Tower collapsing. A   conspiracy theorist attempted to disrupt the day of remembrance numerous times, shouting “  was an inside job” and “The CIA covered it up” while trying to get through various security gates. More than 100 people drowned out his screams by chanting “USA, USA!” and at least one person spit in his face before police escorted him away from the ceremony. Former President George W. Bush, who served as    during the attacks, was notably absent from the ceremony. Instead, he attended a church ceremony in Dallas and then was scheduled to attend the Dallas Cowboys opener against the New York Giants, where he will do a coin toss with two NYPD heroes that bravely served at Ground Zero. President Obama observed a moment of silence at the White House at 8:46 a. m. before heading to the Pentagon, where he will deliver a speech at their ceremony that remembers the 180 killed there. “As Americans, we do not give into fear,” Obama said as he urged the nation to stay united. “It is still and always will be one of our greatest strengths. ”      \n",

            "Message: Lucille Ball statue needs a makeover, locals say    They may have loved ”I Love Lucy” but many in Lucille Ball’s western New York hometown have no affection for her   statue in a local park. Since the bronze sculpture was unveiled in 2009 in Lucille Ball Memorial Park in the village of Celoron, the statue has been blasted by critics who say it bears little or no likeness to the popular 1950s sitcom actress and comedian. Village officials told The   of Jamestown that they’ve talked to the sculptor about making changes to the statue’s face, but the artist wants as much as $10, 000 to alter his artwork. Other sculptors have quoted a price tag of about $5, 000. ”We’d like to work with the original sculptor, and wish he would stand behind his work enough to step up and fix it for free,” Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost told the newspaper. He said no taxpayer funds will be used for the statue project. The village has started a fundraising effort to pay for the sculpture’s makeover. A statue replacement campaign has been launched on Facebook with the name, ”We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue.” The statue was commissioned privately by a couple who hired a sculptor from neighboring Jamestown, 60 miles south of Buffalo. The   statue was installed in August 2009 in a park Celoron, where Ball spent much of her youth. The statue depicts Ball with her signature   hairdo, but the sculpture’s face has been described by some online critics as ”a nightmare” that resembles a drunken zombie. The sculpture shows Ball holding a spoon and a bottle of Vitameatavegamin, a fictional elixir featured in one of her most famous episodes.

            "Message: FBI monitored former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page on Russia Washington (CNN) The FBI obtained a warrant to monitor President Donald Trump’s former campaign adviser, Carter Page, last summer on suspicions he knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow, The Washington Post is reporting. The FBI and Justice Department obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to monitor the communications of Page, who has called himself a junior member of Trump’s foreign policy advisory team, as part of their investigation into possible ties between Trump’s campaign and Russia, the newspaper says, citing unnamed law enforcement and other US officials.  The FBI and Justice Department obtained the warrant after convincing a FISA judge there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign government (Russia) the report says. The warrant presents the strongest information to date that the FBI had reason to believe a Trump adviser was in touch with Moscow and met with foreign operatives during Trump’s presidential campaign. FBI Director James Comey has acknowledged that an investigation was opened last year into Russia’s efforts to influence the election and the question of whether the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. But Comey stopped short of naming anyone working for the campaign who may have been involved. CNN is working to confirm The Washington Post’s story. Page, however, called the FISA warrant ”unjustified” in a statement to CNN’s Manu Raju. ”There have been various reports [about FISA documents and FBI surveillance of him],” Page said. ”But I was so happy to hear that further confirmation is now being revealed. It shows how low the   regime went to destroy our democracy and suppress dissidents who did not fully support their failed foreign policy. It will be interesting to see what comes out when the unjustified basis for those FISA requests are more fully disclosed over time, including potentially the Dodgy Dossier    a document that clearly is false evidence, which could represent yet another potential crime.”  Page was referring to a leaked dossier of unverified information compiled by a former British intelligence official for Trump’s political opponents.    Trump and President Barack Obama were briefed on the existence of the dossier before Trump’s inauguration, CNN reported. When asked in March of last year to list members of his foreign policy team in an interview with The Washington Post, Trump included ”Carter Page, PhD.” Page has said he sent policy memos to the campaign and participated in conference calls as well as gatherings that included Trump, but also said he never personally briefed Trump or was in ”small meetings” with him during the election. But Trump said at a White House news conference in February that he doesn’t think he ever met Page. ”I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him,” Trump said. ”I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very   member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him.” Page told CNN he had never shaken Trump’s hand and that by saying he had met with Trump, he had meant meetings in the ”Russian sense,” which he said meant he had attended rallies Trump spoke at. In recent interviews, Page described himself as a ”junior member” of Trump’s foreign policy team, and has denied working on any   policies for the campaign. He also said in February that he is still in contact with some people in the Trump orbit. \n",

            "Message: Dr. Jane Orient: ‘Universal Coverage Means Less Care’  The executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) observes that any Obamacare health care replacement plan that attempts to implement “universal coverage” will suffer the same outcome as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) since the more “coverage” that is mandated, the less actual “health care” will be available. [Orient emphasizes what has ultimately been the demise of Obamacare. Its supporters say millions more have “coverage,” i. e. insurance cards, though many can’t afford its high premiums and deductibles.  “The reported success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA or ObamaCare) is based on enrollment numbers,” Orient explains. “Millions more have ‘coverage.’ Similarly, the predicted disasters from repeal have to do with loss of coverage. ” The physician continues that plans to provide universal coverage will result in “tens of thousands of deaths. ” In the fervor to keep Obamacare’s   conditions provision and the push further for universal coverage, Orient asks where the data are on the ACA’s actual impact: Where are the statistics about the number of heart operations done on babies born with birth defects, the latest poster children? How about the number of babies saved by this surgery, and the number allowed to die without an attempt at surgery —  before and after ACA? I haven’t seen them. Note that an insurance plan doesn’t do the operation. A doctor does. The insurer can, however, try to block it. Also missing are figures on the number of courses of cancer chemotherapy given, or not given, or the time from diagnosis to death in cancer patients before and after ACA.   survival of cancer patients in the U. S. is generally better than in countries that have universal coverage, or the type of plan progressives want to import. Again, the insurance plan isn’t medicine. You can get medicine without insurance, and if you have insurance it might refuse to pay. Orient observes that, between 2014 and 2015, U. S. mortality rates increased for the first time in decades. “This primarily affected   whites,” she notes. “Is Obamacare the cause? There are many factors involved, drug abuse probably being the most important. But I suspect that if repeal had happened in 2012 or 2013, it would have been blamed. ” “Medicaid expansion may have alleviated fears of medical bankruptcy, but we don’t know that more patients got treatment,” Orient continues. “In   Canada, there is no fear of a medical bill. But there might not be any treatment either. ” In October of last year, Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber admitted the ACA was working just as it was designed  —   jacking up premiums and deductibles, and limiting choices for its customers. “The main goal of Obamacare was ” Gruber, an MIT economics professor, said on CNN, continuing: One was to cover the uninsured, of which we’ve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare. “Jonathan Gruber exposed himself as not credible and simply a propaganda minister of Obamacare when he was exposed explaining the grand deception perpetrated on the American public,” Dr. Gerard Gianoli, a specialist in   and skull base surgery, told Breitbart News. “To claim that Obamacare is working is almost too ridiculous to comment upon, unless the purpose of Obamacare was to drive up insurance premiums, while providing less options for health care and destroying the best medical care system in the world. ” Orient agrees, observing that experts beating the universal healthcare drum “know very well that resources are limited, and that spending (‘costs’) must be contained. ” She adds: They also understand that the burgeoning bureaucracy and its minions and retainers must be well paid. So the answer is to cut services. Some plans “incentivize” doctors to make more money by skimping on care. Others call for a “global budget” —  the deliberate creation of scarcity. When the money is gone, treatment is canceled. There will be fewer beds, fewer CT scanners, fewer drugs, and fewer doctors. But all will be fair. No rationing by price, just by waiting lines, political pull  —   and death. There will be no medical bills to pay after a service, if you get any service. Only taxes in advance, service or no service. Dr. Kristin Held, a   ophthalmologist and surgeon, explains how Obamacare obliterated   medical care and that even many Republicans still refuse to embrace the free market when it comes to health care, a situation that will keep healthcare costs high: In a normal free market, people can look for a less expensive car or a different dealer. But ObamaCare outlawed the insurance products that millions of people had and were satisfied with. No more “bare bones” policies for instance. The leather seats and   entertainment “option” are no longer optional. And no heading to the dealer across the street —  or the state line —  who’ll make you a better deal. The government has fixed the prices, the products, and the dealers. You may be shocked to hear that “ ” Republicans didn’t fix that. They’ll let you do without the car, but you can’t get a cheaper one. After all, the Obama car features are immensely popular. They are certainly popular with certain groups: Held explains that if Republicans retain the “’guaranteed   rating’ features that always and everywhere send premiums into the stratosphere,” insurers can’t price their products by level of risk, and premiums will still go higher. She urges Republicans to address “the entrenched flaws that keep the costs up” in health care. “We must continuously remind ourselves that the goal is survival of our patients, not the survival of big insurance corporations, political careers, and   parasites,” she asserts. “We need an ambulance not a Monster truck, and most importantly we must drain the swamp. ”\n",

            "Message: Pro-Trump Art Show Finds New Venue, Despite Cancellation Attempt And Legal Threats  Lucian Wintrich’s   art show has found a new location in Chelsea, New York City, after their previous venue, The Boiler, forced them out. [Breitbart News can reveal that the show will now be held at 132 West 18th Street, Chelsea, NYC. Tickets are still available, and can be purchased via IndieGoGo.   Wintrich told Breitbart News that it is “a great space in a prime location. ” It will feature exhibits by Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos, Martin Shkreli, James O’Keefe, Gavin McInnes and more, with the highlight being Wintrich’s photoseries of young, gay, male Trump supporters, Twinks4Trump. This is only the latest chapter in a series of dramatic events involving Wintrich’s   show. Before being kicked out of the Pierogi Art Gallery owned venue, the   Joe Amrhein threatened to send all funds paid to the Clinton campaign. Amrhein also claimed that he thought the event was satirical, despite Wintrich providing Breitbart News with texts that show him marking down the event as “Trump Gallery Show” on paper. The venue realtor, Sam Reznitsky, has also threatened to sue Wintrich and “bankrupt” him in the lawsuit. #DaddyWillSaveUs, as it is officially known, has also been targeted by journalists and protesters alike. Earlier in the week, Jamie Peck, a writer for the culture and politics blog, Death and Taxes, sent an email to approximately 200 other journalists demanding that they create a media blackout and ignore the “  clowns” who set up the show. Peck has previously described Twinks4Trump, as “neofascist. ” Mic, the   news and commentary site, also sabotaged a gay military fundraiser at the event. Jack Smith IV, a writer at Mic, persuaded the American Military Partners Association to reject Wintrich’s offer to donate 30% of the proceeds from #DaddyWillSaveUs to the “leading support network for families of LGBTQ veterans. ” Protests were also planned to disrupt the event itself.  Gayletter, a gay magazine based out of New York, included a demand in their latest email to the subscribers to boycott and protest outside the planned location, in order to “hopefully close down the event. ” A Facebook event was also set up entitled “Queer Love Against Trump’s Hate” which argued that the “bigotry and fascism” of the art exhibition must be stopped.

            "Message: Marvel Comics Cancels Black Lives Matter-Themed ’Black Panther’ Due to Poor Sales Marvel Comics has canceled its Black Lives   comic book Black Panther  The Crew due to poor sales, according to reports. [The comic book  —   written by activist author   Coates  —   was canceled after only two issues but is expected to finish out the remainder of its   run, The Verge reported.  The comic features a group of   superheroes including Black Panther, Misty Knight, Luke Cage and Storm  —   the only white person in the “crew” is Kung Fu hero Iron Fist  —   and their investigation into the case of a black civil rights activist who died in police custody in New York City’s famed Harlem neighborhood. The story is set in a New York City patrolled by robot police officers instead of human officials, but much of the plot appears to derive thematically from the Black Lives Matter playbook, with cops beating up minorities for little to no reason and groups of local citizens on the verge of riots over it all. Coates assured fans that with its last few issues, the comic’s storyline would be wrapped up and the mystery of who killed the civil rights activist would be solved. Naturally, the liberal comics community is upset that Marvel has canceled the Black Lives   title. Gawker site Gizmodo complained that Marvel spent no resources advertising or pushing the comic on fans. The site also proclaimed the cancellation “keenly disappointing. ” The cancellation of Black Panther  The Crew comes shortly after a Marvel executive noted during an industry event that comics focused specifically on featuring diverse characters are not selling well. Speaking at a Marvel retailer summit at the end of March, David Gabriel, Marvel’s vice president of sales, said the company had heard that customers “didn’t want” any more diverse characters. “I don’t know that that’s really true, but that’s what we saw in sales,” Gabriel said. “Any character that was diverse, any character that was new, our female characters, anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up. ” The executive made his comments based on recent sales figures but later tried to roll it back after a backlash in the liberal comic book community slammed him as racist. Gabriel later noted that Marvel is still “proud and excited to keep introducing unique characters that reflect new voices and new experiences into the Marvel universe and pair them with our iconic heroes. ” The cancellation also comes ahead of Marvel’s next   adaptation of the Black Panther character. Actor Chadwick Boseman will play the character in Marvel’s Black Panther, due out in February 2018.

            "Message: Libya national army recaptures oil ports at Sidra and Ras Lanuf The worst fighting of Libya’s   civil war has erupted, with battles raging for control of Tripoli and key oil ports, raising the temperature on US claims of increasing Russian influence in the country. In eastern Libya, the army of the national parliament, led by strongman Khalifa Haftar, has recaptured two oil ports, Sidra and Ras Lanuf, from Islamist militias that seized them this month. Meanwhile Tripoli is shuddering under three days of violence between rival militias battling with tanks and artillery. The fighting has intensified a diplomatic spat between Moscow and Washington over claims by unnamed US and Egyptian officials that Russia has deployed special forces and drones to an airbase in western Egypt near the border with Libya. Russia and Egypt have denied the claims, but US senator Lindsey Graham called last week for Moscow’s growing Libya footprint to be put on the “radar screen” of Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. While Russia recognises Libya’s elected parliament in the eastern town of Tobruk, the US and most western powers back a rival, unelected government of national accord (GNA) in Tripoli which they hope can unify the country. In January Moscow invited Haftar for a full dress parade aboard its aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, as it returned from Syria, while Russia’s   oil giant Rosneft has announced plans for major new investments in Libya.  Visiting Moscow this week seeking military aid, the parliament’s president, Agila Saleh, told the RIA Novosti news agency: “We asked the Russian government to help us with training the soldiers in our armed forces and the repair of military equipment. ” Analysts say Russia’s growing involvement in Libya has come as the US is distracted by crises elsewhere in the world. “As in Syria, Russia’s interest [in Libya] is opportunistic,” said Geoff Porter, the director of   North Africa Risk Consulting. “Moscow saw an opening that was afforded to it by Washington’s lack of leadership. ” No reliable casualty figures have yet been reported from the violence of recent days in Tripoli, with militias battling each other in western and central districts. Flights were suspended from the city centre airport as stray rockets hit buildings across the city. “There are explosions everywhere  —   you can never know when clashes will take place,” one resident, who asked not be be named, emailed from the city. “I’m scared of going out and getting stuck in crossfire. ” The UN envoy to Libya, Martin Kobler, tweeted: Western powers are struggling to shore up support for the GNA, which was created by a   commission and is intended to share power between parliament and groups including a militia coalition, Libya Dawn, that controls Tripoli. But parliament is divided and has yet to accept the GNA, while it operates its own government in the east complete with a separate currency. Tobruk’s position has been strengthened because the capture of the oil ports gives it control of the Sirte basin, home to the bulk of Libya’s oil wealth. Nor has the GNA succeeded in wooing Libya Dawn, whose militias are continuing to battle in Tripoli, some for the GNA, others for yet another   administration, the Salvation Government. Wednesday’s fighting saw   militias storm the Salvation Government compound at the luxury Rixos hotel. Last month the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, called for Haftar to be included in the GNA, but some diplomats fear that if that happened, Libya Dawn would reject it, leaving the country still locked in   stalemate.\n",

            "Message: What Bernie Sanders needs to learn from Hillary Clinton, and vice versa  A  steady drip of comments just before the Iowa caucuses has left little doubt: Many former Obama aides consider Hillary Clinton his natural heir. One former staffer put it pretty directly, saying that Bernie Sanders’s campaign “resembles Howard Dean’s a lot more than it resembles Barack Obama’s. ”  It was a clear shorthand for “insurgent who lost”  —   fair enough. Obama’s the insurgent who won, right?  But that isn’t really the whole story. The Obama organization’s strength eight years ago came from its unlikely and somehow functional mix of insurgents and insiders. This time, the two leading Democrats are each succeeding in only half of that equation  —   and that’s a problem they will both need to solve to have the best chance at winning a general election.  (Two disclaimers at this point. One: I ran Obama’s digital efforts in 2008 and 2012, but I don’t personally have a candidate in this race. Two: The company I lead, Blue State Digital, has done work for all three Democratic presidential campaigns and the Democratic National Committee this cycle.) Obama’s 2008 campaign achieved an incredibly difficult balance, making an orderly organization out of the pragmatic and the   alike. Many senior staffers were operatives who’d worked in Congress or for previous Democratic presidential bids, but a huge portion of the wider team, especially in the field and digital operations, had little previous campaign experience, if they had any. Obama himself reflected these two sides: The measured constitutional law professor was also the community organizer who’d opposed “ a dumb war ” in Iraq.  That a   movement propelled Obama in 2008 is  : A huge share of our volunteers and   donors were engaging with the political process deeply for the very first time. But that campaign redefined modern election tactics not only by raising a massive   insurgency but by playing the inside game well.  The insiders were crucial in building the case for Obama with outreach to elected officials, big donors and superdelegate types who could help him secure the Democratic nomination and the influence of the mainstream media. The finance team matched Clinton and outpaced John McCain in 2008, and then Mitt Romney in 2012, dollar for dollar in large contributions. Those insiders built a kind of scaffolding, and the insurgent grass roots stretched to bring in more   donations than any other campaign in history and did the hard work at the doors, on the phones and in the community that provided our margin of victory. That inside game is the sort of campaign that Clinton has excelled at, especially in this cycle, and it’s been one of Sanders’s biggest weaknesses up to now. But one of the underappreciated consequences of those Obama campaigns, which we’re seeing play out in this primary and will be felt for years to come, has been the modernization of mass mobilization in the Democratic Party. Thousands of staffers and volunteers got the training and seasoning that come with being part of a big, broad   effort.  This means there’s a new default level of sophistication for a Democratic presidential campaign. Both the Clinton and Sanders teams inherited an ingrained culture of constant testing and   optimization that shapes every ad, every email, every call script for a volunteer and every list of voters they call. And both campaigns have built their organizing efforts on the foundation of tech and data infrastructure at the Democratic National Committee that first came together in the 2008 cycle. This modernization of   also means that the potency of an   campaign has grown  —   by a lot. In a previous era, a candidate like Sanders might have been deprived of the scarce talent or limited party infrastructure needed to mount an   campaign. But Sanders has been able to make use of the wide talent pool and the specific tech cultivated by Obama, and he’s now surpassed the pace of   fundraising that the Obama campaign set in 2008 and 2012, with more than 2. 5 million individual contributions before the Iowa caucuses. (Obama, by the end of 2011, had 2. 2 million.) That’s not because he’s a more compelling candidate than Obama or because he’s got a better shot of winning than Obama did at this point in the 2008 race. But the people doing the organizing and   fundraising, and the technology platforms they use, trace their roots to the insurgent branch of the Obama campaign  —   and in some cases even to Dean’s campaign and his tenure as chairman at the DNC. Perhaps even more important than skills and software, the insurgents have been emboldened with the audacity to think they can win. And it’s clear that, whether you support him or not, Sanders’s campaign is the home of the prevailing   energy in this race. The most recent financial reports, for the period that ended in October, showed that the amount Clinton raised from donors giving less than $200 decreased from $8 million to $5. 2 million, while Sanders’s   take nearly doubled, from $10. 4 million to $20. 2 million. Clinton raised barely a quarter of the amount from   donors that Sanders did. Whatever the ultimate result, that shows the Sanders campaign has accomplished extraordinary things in volunteer mobilization and   fundraising, period. Those accomplishments are all the more remarkable for just how isolated from elites Sanders’s campaign is. One tally of endorsements by various elected officials puts Clinton ahead of Sanders 458 to 2. Even more than Dean in 2004, Sanders is running a true outsider bid. Yes, there was an outpouring of   support for Dean (I worked on that campaign, too) but he also had an inside game that people tend to forget. Heading into Iowa, he had endorsements from Al Gore, former Texas governor Ann Richards, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, and big unions such as the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The campaign just blew it, failing to turn either all that insider cred or its insurgent energy into a functioning organization.  Obama proved there’s no reason to conflate “insurgent” with “disorganized. ” But Clinton is actually playing the inside game now better than she did eight years ago: Her total dominance among party leadership far exceeds her 2008 position or even Gore’s over Bill Bradley in 2000. Whether you support her or not, she and her team set out to build  —   and have built  —   the kind of base that, if not for the new durability of an insurgency like Sanders’s, would have cleared the field and made for a formidable, unified front in November. A successful   campaign requires that kind of skill and political organization. Without it, even the   insurgent campaign won’t be sufficient to marshal a major political party to victory.  No matter who wins, though, this primary season has shown  —   even before the voting begins  —   that our eventual nominee will need to figure out how their organization can replicate what the other candidate has done so well. If Clinton prevails, she’ll need to find a way to build the   side of her campaign and encourage the many people who are legitimately excited about her candidacy to be more actively engaged in it. If Sanders wins, he’ll need to pay far more attention to traditional politics than he’s done so far, in order to leverage the institutional support that the Democratic Party apparatus can provide its nominee. The winner will be tempted to view victory as a validation of the   or   approach. But they will need to grapple with the reality that the opponent they’ve just defeated will, nevertheless, have accomplished something they didn’t.

            "Message: TIME: Trump Loss Could Result in ’A New Right-Wing Populist Party, Anchored by a Trump-Breitbart-Ailes Media Empire’  From Joe Klein writing at TIME magazine:  Donald Trump will probably lose this election, which is good news. Here’s the bad news: that loss may be just the beginning of Trump’s toxic presence in American political life. Nightmare scenarios are floating through Republican circles. The best cases posit a bitter and continuing Republican civil war between the Trump and “Establishment” factions of the party. The worst cases involve a clean break, a new   populist party, anchored by a    media empire. The mud generated by this new faction, fed by WikiLeaks and the Russians, could splash across the political spectrum, creating a perpetual fever swamp of conspiracy theories and calls for special prosecutors, crippling a Hillary Clinton presidency. Goth politics may be the new normal.   …     So let’s say, for the sake of argument, that Trump wins 50 million votes on Election Day —  a losing total, and probably the low end of his expectations. Let’s also stipulate that at least half of those voters are reflexive Republicans who will hold their noses and vote for their party’s nominee. That leaves up to 25 million hardcore Trumpists as the potential market for a new network. There are reports that Trump’s    Jared Kushner is trying to find investors. Trump’s campaign orbit —  a ridiculous political operation —  looks far more plausible as a communications company: Steve Bannon of Breitbart, Roger Ailes and Roger Stone. Even Newt Gingrich is more plausible these days as a performer than as a politician. Read the rest of the story at TIME.\n",

            "Message: Clinton Powers Through Super Tuesday, Sets Sights On Trump Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton celebrated a victorious Super Tuesday in an address to her supporters at a rally in Miami, after primary wins in states across the South. “All across our country today, Democrats voted to break down barriers so we can all rise together,” Clinton said. She made the speech as results were still rolling in from the states that held their Democratic primaries Tuesday. She scored an early wave of victories in states in the South, in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. She also picked up Massachusetts. Her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) meanwhile, won in his home state of Vermont, and in Colorado, Oklahoma and Minnesota. Clinton’s speech hinted that Democrats were on their to uniting behind her candidacy.  She also took shots at Donald Trump    who had his own big victories Tuesday    while decrying broader tone of the GOP race. “I believe what we need in America today is more love and kindness. You know what, it works. Instead of building walls, we’re going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment so every American can live up to his or her potential because then and only then can America live up to its full potential too,” she said. ”It’s clear tonight that the stakes in this election have never been higher, and the rhetoric we’re hearing on the other side has never been lower.” She hit many of her top policy campaign priorities    such as economic opportunity, gender equality, and racial justice    while she previewed the kind of contrast she would draw with a Republican nominee in the general election, particularly if that nominee was Trump  “We know we’ve got work to do. That work, that work is not to make America great again. America never stopped being great,” she said. “We have to make America whole. We have to fill in what’s been hollowed out. We have to make strong the broken place, restitch the bonds of trust and respect across our country. ” Sanders gave his own Super Tuesday speech in Vermont earlier in the evening, after his win there had been projected, but before many of the other races had been called. Sanders thanked his home state for voting ”so strongly to put us in the White House” and reminded his supporters that the delegates allotted in Super Tuesday were not ”  .” ”What I have said is that this campaign is not just about electing a president. It is about making a political revolution,” Sanders said.\n",

            "Message: Warren Buffett: I bought $12 billion of stock after Trump won Buffett revealed that he has bought $12 billion of stock for his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( ) since the Republican Donald Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U. S. presidential election. In an interview with talk show host Charlie Rose that aired on Friday night, Buffett suggested that Berkshire’s   stock purchases overall were even higher, reflecting stocks that his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler bought. ”We’ve, net, bought $12 billion of common stocks since the election,” Buffett said. ”The guys that work with me, the two fellows, they probably bought a little bit or sold a little bit too.” The speed with which Berkshire is buying stocks is unusual. It has spent in fewer than three months roughly half what it spent on equities in the three years ending Sept. 30, 2016. Buffett demurred on whether Berkshire has added to its stakes in the four largest U. S. airlines: American Airlines Group Inc ( ) Delta Air Lines Inc ( ) Southwest Airlines Co ( ) and United Continental Holdings Inc ( ). Berkshire revealed those stakes in   surprising many given Buffett’s long aversion to the sector. Asked why Berkshire dove in, Buffett said: ”It was in large part my decision.” Berkshire will likely by Feb. 14 disclose some of the stocks it has bought, in a regulatory filing listing most of its U. S. holdings as of year end. The Omaha,   conglomerate owned $102. 5 billion of equities as of Sept. 30, excluding its stake in Kraft Heinz Co ( ). U. S. stocks rose after Trump was elected, reflecting investor optimism that his policies might boost economic growth, aided by a Congress also under Republican control. Editor’s pick:  Drug companies ”have to get prices down”: Trump Buffett said Trump is unlikely to reach his goal of 4 percent annual growth, but that growth at half that level would over a generation add $19, 000 per person to real gross domestic product. ”Two percent will produce miracles,” Buffett said.

S. business Michael Horn will leave the company “to pursue other opportunities,” the company said today. The statement did not mention Volkswagen’s emissions cheating scandal, but Horn is just the latest senior executive to leave in the wake of the discovery. The company’s chief executive officer Martin Winterkorn resigned in September after it emerged that Volkswagen engineers had installed software on millions of cars that allowed them to pass emissions tests despite far exceeding regulatory guidelines while actually on the road. Volkswagen USA said that, effective immediately, the chairman of Volkswagen USA, Hinrich Woebcken would take over as interim CEO. While Horn has not been directly linked to any wrongdoing, he testified in front of Congress in October to explain Volkswagen’s behavior. Horn told lawmakers that almost 500, 000 cars on the road in the U. S. would require some kind of fix. He described the installation of the “defeat device” as “not a corporate decision” and that internal and external investigations would “find out what drove those people into these decisions and those actions. ” At a product launch soon after regulators revealed the emissions cheat, Horn said “we have totally screwed up. ” Volkswagen has said that up to 11 million vehicles have the cheating software. Horn had worked at Volkswagen for over 25 years, the company said, and took over as head of Volkswagen’s U. S. division in 2014.  \n",

Many of the veterans are in their twilight years, with ages in the late 80s and the 90s. The teenager, Rishi Sharma, has started a nonprofit organization, Heroes of the Second World War, to record video interviews with them for posterity. Of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II, about 620, 000 are still alive, and 372 die each day, according to the National World War II Museum. The teenager, who graduated last year from Agoura High School outside Los Angeles, wrote on a crowdfunding page that there is “no commercial aspect” to the project. He said he’s putting off many of the typical priorities of    like going to college, finding a job or dating, so that he can focus on the project. “These men are my biggest heroes and my closest friends,” Mr. Sharma wrote. “I am just trying to get a better understanding of what they had to go through in order for me and so many others to be here today and to get a better appreciation for how good I have it. ” Mr. Sharma received an influx of donations on Friday as the United States commemorated Veterans Day. Across the country, Americans  —   including President Obama, who laid a wreath in Arlington Cemetery in Washington  —   led tributes to past and present military members.

            "Message: Auto CEOs want Trump to order review of 2025 fuel rules  The chief executives of 18 major automakers and their U. S. units urged President Donald Trump to revisit a decision by the Obama administration to lock in vehicle fuel efficiency rules through 2025. In a letter sent late Friday and viewed by Reuters, the chief executives of General Motors Co ( ) Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, along with the top North American executives at Toyota Motor Corp ( ) Volkswagen AG ( ) Honda Motor Co ( ) Hyundai Motor Co ( ) Nissan Motor Co ( ) and others urged Trump to reverse the decision, warning thousands of jobs could be at risk. On Jan. 13, the head of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by then President Barack Obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration’s climate legacy. As part of a 2012 regulation, EPA had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the   model year vehicle emission rules requiring average   efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon through a ”midterm review.” The agency in November moved up the timetable for proposing automakers could meet the 2025 standards. The auto CEO letter asked Trump to reopen the midterm review ”without prejudging the outcome” and praised Trump’s ”personal focus on steps to strengthen the economy in the United States and your commitment to jobs in our sector.” Days after Trump was elected, automakers quickly appealed to Trump to review the rules, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said Sunday, automakers are ”seeking a restoration of the process    that’s all. This is a reset.” The chief executives of Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler also raised the issue in a White House meeting with Trump last month. The letter warned the rules could ”threaten future production levels, putting hundreds of thousands and perhaps as many as a million jobs at risk.” Environmentalists say the rules are working, saving drivers thousands in fuel costs and shouldn’t be changed. Luke Tonachel of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said lowering the standards would ”cost consumers more, increase our dependence on oil and put Americans at greater risk from a changing climate.” Trump EPA nominee Scott Pruitt told a Senate panel he will review the Obama administration’s decision. In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54. 5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1. 7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. The EPA said in July that because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it estimated the fleet will average 50. 8 mpg to 52. 6 mpg in 2025.

The Warriors won the NBA Finals four games to two, winning the last three contests. ”They were all in it just to win,” rookie coach Steve Kerr said of his players. ”This is an amazing group of guys.” The   NBA champion Warriors were led Tuesday by Stephen Curry and Andre Iguodala, who each scored 25 points. Iguodala, who started zero games during the regular season but was inserted into the first five during the Finals, was named MVP of the series.  ”We are going to remember this for a long time,” he said.

            "Message: Look Who Now Refuses to ‘Accept the Result of This Election’ ‘Horrifying. ” That’s how Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton described GOP   Donald J. Trump’s statement in the final, October 19 presidential debate. Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace asked Trump whether  —   even facing defeat  —   he would “absolutely accept the result of this election. ” Trump answered, “I will look at it at the time. ” He added: “We’ll find out on November 8th. . . . I’ll keep you in suspense. ” Maybe Trump wanted room to address a potential Bush v. Gore —  style virtual tie, perhaps involving today’s equivalent of hanging chads. “On Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done. He refused to say he would respect the results of this election,” Clinton told voters in Cleveland two days hence. “Now, make no mistake, by doing that he is threatening our democracy. ” She continued: “We know in our country, the difference between leadership and dictatorship. ” Clinton’s bodyguards in the liberal media echoed her sentiments. “The candidate’s reckless closing message that nothing is on the level  —   not Democrats, not the press, not the polls, not Republican leaders, not even the integrity of the voting process  —   has left many of his supporters prepared to declare the election results illegitimate,” the Washington Post’s Dana Milbank lectured. In an article headlined “Donald Trump’s astonishing, damaging refusal to accept the fundamental premise of American elections,” the Washington Post’s Phillip Bump scolded, “He’s willing to cast a shadow over the process that undergirds the most prosperous, stable nation in world history. ” Of course, within three weeks, the   Democrat lost to the hopeless Republican. While Trump won only 46 percent of the popular vote to 48 percent for Clinton, the New York   magnate took the tally that mattered, with an upset,   margin in the Electoral College, 306 votes to 232. (Losing the Electoral College but winning the presidential popular vote is an interesting but inconsequential consolation prize  —   much like a baseball team with fewer runs than its opponents, but more base hits.) Trump’s 57 percent to 43 percent Electoral College triumph remains one of the most stunning finishes in American history. As members of the Electoral College cast their ballots in state capitals across America today, it is instructive to recall how holistically Hillary Clinton, her supporters, and other Trumpophobes have abandoned “the way our democracy works,” as Clinton put it. Nearly six weeks after the polls closed, leftists refuse to accept Trump’s victory. They too often resemble Venezuelan street mobs. Their despicable actions are altogether  . Consider just a few of the countless ways  —   large and small  —   that hordes of Hillary’s fans and Donald’s foes   have rejected the outcome of November 8’s free, fair, and decisive presidential election. Not just for a few days, but for weeks, Clinton’s supporters marched through the streets and sometimes prevented regular citizens from going about their business. Many of these protesters bore signs that read “Not my president” and “We don’t accept the  . ” Liberals demonstrated that “Love Trumps hate” by blocking freeways in Los Angeles, smashing store windows and   windshields in Portland, Ore. setting trashcans ablaze in Oakland, and otherwise proving that, in reality, “Left hates Trump. ” A Muslim woman named Yasmin Sewied claimed that three drunks confronted her on a Manhattan subway train on December 1, called her a “terrorist,” told her, “Go back to your country,” tried to grab her headscarf, and shouted, “Trump! Trump!” Sewied now faces criminal charges. She lied to the police about this “incident,” which she totally invented. Sewied had been out drinking with friends and concocted an imaginary hate crime to gain sympathy with her devoutly Islamic parents. They already were upset that she dated a Catholic. So, as the New York Post reported, Sewied tarred Trump fans with lies. In a genuine subway assault, Corey Cataldo, a    white man wearing a Make America Great Again hat, was attacked on a Number 5 train in the Bronx on November 12. According to police, a   tall,   black man saw the hat and asked Cataldo, “Are you a Trump supporter?” After Cataldo said yes, the attacker replied, “Great. Another white Trump supporter. ” He then tried to strangle Cataldo with his bare hands before fleeing the subway train at 149th Street. In yet another outburst of political violence, David Wilcox, a white driver in Chicago, emerged from his Pontiac Bonneville after a black sedan scraped it on the day after the election. “I got out of the car,” Wilcox later told the Chicago Tribune, “One of the guys  —   an   at the bus stop  —   said, ‘Yeah, that’s one of those   Trump supporters.’ And I said, ‘What’s that got to do with this accident? I just want to exchange insurance.’ And then, next thing I know, the guy said, ‘Don’t worry about it. We’re going to beat his ass. ’” Wilcox soon was brutalized in broad daylight by black thugs and repeatedly beaten, shoved to the ground, kicked on the asphalt, and punched in his head. One witness to this mayhem, which is on video, gleefully yelled, “You voted Trump! You voted Trump! Daaaaaaaamn!” Others reportedly shouted: “Don’t vote Trump,” and “You gonna pay for that shit!” A black man stole Wilcox’s car and dragged him along its side, as Wilcox hung on for his life through an open window. He finally let go and rolled five to seven times along Roosevelt Road before stopping in an   lane. He was treated for his injuries at Mount Sinai Hospital and released. Wilcox, in fact, voted for Trump, although the racist onlookers to the attack only assumed as much because of his complexion. “What’s happening to America?” a badly bruised Wilcox asked the Chicago Tribune the next day. “You’re supposed to be able to vote in peace. It’s supposed to be part of our democracy, and what happened is I vote for somebody, and I get beaten, robbed, and my car stolen, and I have no way of getting my wife to and from work safe anymore. ” Chicago police on November 18 arrested Julian Christian, 26 Dejuan Collins, 20 Rajane Lewis, 21 and an unidentified    female. Each faces one felony count of vehicular hijacking. Police say these four pounded Wilcox. Monisha Rajesh, a train columnist with The Telegraph of London, said this via Twitter on Election Night: “It’s about time for a presidential assassination. ” After   nominee Jill Stein launched recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton’s campaign stepped in to support her efforts, thoroughly contradicting every consonant that Clinton had uttered about the sanctity of losers’ accepting election results. While judges eventually halted the   in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Wisconsin’s was completed. Rather than help Stein or Clinton, the Badger State recount revealed 131 additional votes for Trump. The Left has sunk   intransigence to a spectacular and unprecedented new low: tampering with the Electoral College itself. Calling themselves Americans Take Action, actors including Martin Sheen and Noah Wyle appeared in a TV ad supported by a $500, 000 media buy. They urged GOP Electoral College members to dump Trump, the will of their states’ voters be damned. Even worse,   electors have faced heretofore unseen intimidation by Clinton’s supporters, some of whom placed those electors’ personal details online. The lucky ones have coped only with hostile   letters, and phone calls  —   often in the thousands. It is total harassment,” said Robert Graham, an Arizona elector and state GOP chairman. As the Arizona Republic reported on November 18, Graham added: “It started about a week ago. Now? ‘Bam!’ It’s hardcore. ” Arizona’s Sharon Geise said that she has received some 50, 000   since the election, pushing her to ditch Trump. “They just keep coming and coming,” she told the New York Post. “They’re overpowering my iPad. ” Others have endured far uglier bullying. Bruce Ash, an elector and one of Arizona’s three Republican National Committee members, told the Republic that he has received hundreds of phone calls in “an outright political maneuver. ” Ash said, “They demonize me, they call me a homophobic, an isolationist, a bigot, a misogynist, and an   which is interesting because I’m Jewish. ” Texas elector Rex Teter received a letter that read, “May your tombstone and life be a laughing fallacy if you let this evil in the gate. ” “I have been inundated with death threats, death wishes, generally angry messages trying to get me to change my vote to Hillary Clinton or another person,” Michigan GOP elector Michael Banerian told CNN. “I’ve had people talk about putting a bullet in the back of my mouth. I’ve had death wishes or people just saying, ‘I hope you die.’ Or, ‘Do society a favor, throw yourself in front of a bus.’ . . . These people not only called for the burning of myself, but my family. ’” “In Pennsylvania,” according to today’s edition of the Telegraph, “the situation has become so serious that some 20 electors have reportedly been assigned plainclothes state police troopers for protection. ” One of them, Ash Khare, is an Indian immigrant and longtime Republican. He confirms being guarded by state law enforcement and said that he has received “nasty” phone calls as late as 1:00 a. m. “I’m a big boy,” Khare told the Philadelphia Inquirer. “But this is stupid. Nobody is standing up and telling these people, ‘Enough. Knock it off. ’” Now imagine if Hillary Clinton had won this election and Trump’s supporters behaved like leftists. Democrats, how would you like that? Of course, this is an absurd hypothetical. Republicans and conservatives grumble and grind their molars when their   lose. What they don’t do is destroy personal property, blockade highways, commit arson, and terrorize members of the Electoral College. The Right was saddened to see Obama beat Mitt Romney and John McCain. Nonetheless, Obama’s allies freely backed him in the Electoral College without suffering through TV ads and even highly felonious death threats demanding that they vote him down. More Electoral CollegeAmerica’s CollegeWhat Trump calls Schumer, c. The Culinary CultMeanwhile, when will the FBI and the Justice Department’s Voting Rights and Civil Rights divisions start probing and prosecuting these death threats? If Attorney General Loretta Lynch refuses to lift a finger, incoming attorney general Jeff Sessions must make this a high priority and a teaching moment for these   criminals. As low as the Left has fallen, their rejectionism is far from finished. Radical cineaste Michael Moore wants enraged Democrats and other election deniers to flood Washington next January 20 and “disrupt the Inauguration. ” This suggests that the last six weeks of leftist fury were just the beginning. American liberals never will accept that Donald J. Trump won the November 8 election  —   fair and square. All they are saying is they won’t give Trump a chance.,\n",

            "Message: Obama Climate Plan, Now in Court, May Hinge on Error in 1990 Law  WASHINGTON  —   The pitched battle over President Obama’s signature climate change policy, which is moving to the courts this week, carries considerable political, economic and historical stakes. Yet its legal fate, widely expected to be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, could rest on a clerical error in an obscure provision of a    law. That error, which left conflicting amendments on power plant regulation in the Clean Air Act, will be a major focus of oral arguments by opponents of Mr. Obama’s initiative when the case is heard on Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The initiative, known as the Clean Power Plan, which Mr. Obama sees as at the heart of his climate change legacy, gave the United States critical leverage to broker the landmark 2015 Paris climate change accord. If the plan is struck down, the United States, the world’s largest carbon polluter over the centuries, will lose its main tool to cut greenhouse gas emissions. If it is upheld, it will transform the nation’s electricity system, closing hundreds of   power plants and setting in motion a wholesale shift to wind, solar and nuclear power, as well as to improved electric transmission systems.   states and more than 100 companies and labor and industry groups are fighting to overturn the plan. Defending it are 18 states and dozens of environmental and public health groups that have joined forces with the Obama administration. Nearly 20 lawyers will take turns arguing the case before 10 judges  —   much larger than the typical   panel. The judges have allocated four hours to hear the arguments, rather than the usual one or two. The chief judge of the court, Merrick B. Garland, who is also Mr. Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, has recused himself. Adding to the drama will be the presence of Mr. Obama’s mentor at Harvard Law School, Laurence H. Tribe, who will argue against the climate plan on behalf of the nation’s largest coal company, Peabody Energy. The   clerical error at issue in the case  —   State of West Virginia, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency  —   involves an update to the Clean Air Act passed by Congress in 1990. The Clean Air Act of 1970 is the legal foundation of the Clean Power Plan. An obscure provision in the law  —   Section 111( d)  —   gave the E. P. A. broad authority to regulate unknown future pollutants. At the time, carbon dioxide, the nontoxic but   gas that is the chief cause of global warming, was not considered a pollutant. In 1990, when Congress passed the update to the Clean Air Act, it amended Section 111( d). A version of the amendment passed by the House said that if the E. P. A. was already regulating power plant pollution under a separate section of the law, it could not use Section 111( d) to create new regulations on the same plants. A version of the amendment passed by the Senate, however, did allow such overlapping regulation. When the two bills were merged, lawmakers forgot to strike out one of the conflicting amendments in the   rush to push the bill through. So it was signed into law by President George Bush with both amendments. Opponents of the Clean Power Plan will argue on Tuesday that a strict interpretation of the House amendment would render the plan illegal. Last year, when the E. P. A. issued the Clean Power Plan, it used Section 111( d) to justify placing new regulations on carbon dioxide emissions from   power plants. The agency has also long regulated toxic power plant pollutants, such as mercury, under a different section, 112, of the Clean Air Act. “In 1990, Congress dramatically expanded the Clean Air Act, and when they did that, they said an industry cannot be ” said Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer representing many of the groups suing the administration. Sean Donahue, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund who will argue this portion of the case before the court, called that legal interpretation “preposterous. ” “It’s very interesting that there was this legislative glitch,” he said. Environmentalists and the administration will argue that because the two types of pollutants are so different, the E. P. A. is justified in using two sections of the law to regulate them. “This bizarre proposition is like exempting restaurants from food handling requirements because they are subject to the fire code,” Mr. Donahue said. Opponents of the plan will also focus on two other main points, arguing that Mr. Obama has exceeded his executive authority. While environmental regulations under the Clean Air Act often require states to cut pollution by using specific technology, such as affixing “scrubbers” to smokestacks, the Clean Power Plan goes further: It asks states to reduce pollution by making changes to their entire electricity systems  —   shutting down coal plants, and building wind and solar plants. The plan also encourages states to reduce emissions by putting in place “  ” systems, which would create state or regional caps on emissions and allow companies to buy and sell credits to pollute. In his first term, Mr. Obama tried but failed to push a    bill through Congress. Now, his opponents say, he is using regulation to force the system through. “The E. P. A. is going beyond what it’s authorized to do by Congress and essentially creating new law,” said Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, a leader in coordinating the legal opposition to the plan. David Doniger, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which worked closely with the Obama administration to draft the plan, dismissed that objection, noting that the E. P. A. already uses a    system to regulate other sources of pollution. Given the high stakes, the two sides have gone to unusual lengths in their preparation, including what longtime activists say is an unprecedented level of counterintelligence work. Consultants have been gathering   details about how their opponents are organizing their side of the fight, in an attempt to find embarrassing tidbits that might undermine their arguments, at least in the public’s eye. Both sides have spent months filing Freedom of Information requests and related lawsuits to obtain email correspondence and other records from their opponents. Environmental groups sought emails between the state attorneys general who are challenging the Clean Power Plan and executives from the coal and electric utility industries. Lawyers and consultants paid by the energy industry have sought records showing that environmentalists have worked closely with liberal politicians who support the plan. “Transparency is a good thing, so having more of these documents serves the public,” said Kert Davies, the executive director of a group called the Climate Investigations Center, which has helped gather counterintelligence information on opponents of the Clean Power Plan. “But it is certainly an escalating war, back and forth. The intensity has peaked. ”\n",

            "Message: E.P.A. Head Stacks Agency With Climate Change Skeptics  WASHINGTON  —   Days after the Senate confirmed him as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference and was asked about addressing a group that probably wanted to eliminate his agency. “I think it’s justified,” he responded, to cheers. “I think people across the country look at the E. P. A. the way they look at the I. R. S. ” In the days since, Mr. Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who built a career out of suing the agency he now leads, has moved to stock the top offices of the agency with   conservatives  —   many of them skeptics of climate change and all of them intent on rolling back environmental regulations that they see as overly intrusive and harmful to business. Mr. Pruitt has drawn heavily from the staff of his friend and fellow Oklahoma Republican, Senator James Inhofe, long known as Congress’s most prominent skeptic of climate science. A former Inhofe chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, will be Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff. Another former Inhofe staff member, Byron Brown, will serve as Mr. Jackson’s deputy. Andrew Wheeler, a fossil fuel lobbyist and a former Inhofe chief of staff, is a finalist to be Mr. Pruitt’s deputy, although he requires confirmation to the position by the Senate. To friends and critics, Mr. Pruitt seems intent on building an E. P. A. leadership that is fundamentally at odds with the career officials, scientists and employees who carry out the agency’s missions. That might be a recipe for strife and gridlock at the federal agency tasked to keep safe the nation’s clean air and water while safeguarding the planet’s future. “He’s the most different kind of E. P. A. administrator that’s ever been,” said Steve J. Milloy, a member of the E. P. A. transition team who runs the website JunkScience. com, which aims to debunk climate change. “He’s not coming in thinking E. P. A. is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Quite the opposite. ” Gina McCarthy, who headed the E. P. A. under former President Barack Obama, said she too saw Mr. Pruitt as unique. “It’s fine to have differing opinions on how to meet the mission of the agency. Many Republican administrators have had that,” she said. “But here, for the first time, I see someone who has no commitment to the mission of the agency. ” A pair of Trump campaigners from Washington State are also heading into senior positions at the E. P. A. Don Benton, a former Washington state senator who headed President Trump’s state campaign, will be the agency’s senior liaison with the White House. Douglas Ericksen, a current Washington state senator, is being considered as the regional administrator of the E. P. A. ’s Pacific Northwest office. As a state senator, Mr. Ericksen has been active in opposing efforts to pass a   climate change law taxing carbon pollution. Last month, he invited Tony Heller, a climate denialist who blogs under the pseudonym Steven Goddard, to address a Washington State Senate committee on the costs of climate change policy. Mr. Heller’s blog says “global warming is the biggest fraud in science history. ” “I think the reason both of these guys are being considered for this stuff is they were the only prominent elected officials in the state of Washington that were early supporters and organizers for Trump,” said Todd Donovan, a political scientist at Western Washington University. “No other state legislators were putting their necks out for Trump. ” Another transition official under consideration by Mr. Pruitt for a permanent position is David Kreutzer, a senior research fellow in energy economics and climate change at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has publicly praised the benefits of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That view stands in opposition to the broad scientific consensus that increased carbon dioxide traps heat and contributes to the dangerous warming of the planet. The agency’s policy agenda is snapping into focus: Last week, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of dismantling a major   regulation aimed at increasing the federal government’s authority over rivers, streams and wetlands in order to prevent water pollution. Also last week, Mr. Pruitt ordered the agency to walk back a program on collecting data on methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells. This week, Mr. Trump is expected to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama’s E. P. A. regulations aimed at curbing   pollution from   power plants, and Mr. Pruitt is expected to announce plans to begin to weaken an   rule mandating higher fuel economy standards. A draft White House budget blueprint proposes to slash the E. P. A. budget by about 24 percent, or $2 billion from its current level of $8. 1 billion, and cut employee numbers by about 20 percent from its current staff of about 15, 000. Agency employees say morale has already been damaged. After working for years to draft climate change regulations under the Obama administration, many of those same career scientists and lawyers will be ordered to go back and undo them. Ms. McCarthy, who oversaw the writing and execution of those major water and climate change regulations, said it would be difficult and   to reverse them, especially if Mr. Trump succeeds in greatly downsizing the agency. “If you want to do these executive orders that require a whole rewrite of the rule, you have to get that right, legally,” she said. “It took years to do those rules. To now ask for those things to be undone with less staff and low morale  —   how are they going to do it?” There is one area in which Mr. Pruitt has vowed to continue the traditional work of the E. P. A.: a longstanding program for sending funds to states to clean up “brownfields”  —   former industrial sites that have been contaminated by pollution. Although Mr. Trump’s budget blueprint would slash funds for that program, Mr. Pruitt pledged to a gathering of mayors in Washington last week that he would fight to save the program. “With the White House and Congress I am communicating a message about brownfields,” he told mayors. “I want to hear from you about successes and communicate them. ” J. Christian Bollwage, the Democratic mayor of Elizabeth, N. J. a city that has been plagued with industrial pollution, said he was heartened to hear the pledge. “I’ve never heard such a vociferous defense of providing brownfields grants,” he said. “He was explicit. He said he was going to take the defense of brownfields to the White House. I was impressed and hopeful. ” But, Mr. Bollwage added, “Coming from New Jersey, climate change is also a big issue. And I’m still worried about an administration that seems to think climate change is a hoax. ” Concern over Mr. Pruitt’s stewardship may not be  . There is speculation that the E. P. A. chief already has his eyes on a different office. Mr. Inhofe, 82, will complete his current Senate term in 2020. While he declined to speak of his retirement plans, Mr. Inhofe said of Mr. Pruitt, “I think he’d make a great senator. ”\n",

            "Message: Patient secretly recorded doctors as they operated on her. Should she be so distressed by what she heard?        Last summer, Ethel Easter wanted nothing more than to see a doctor. A hiatal hernia had caused her to suffer more than a hundred abdominal attacks within 24 hours, her stomach was bruised, and she found blood in her urine. The pain was excruciating, so Easter prayed that a surgery could be scheduled as soon as possible. The doctor who would be operating on her at Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital in Houston did not share her urgency. He told the    Easter that she would have to wait two months, and Easter burst into tears. “I can’t do this for two months,” she cried. “I can’t do this anymore. ” “Well, who do you think you are?” Easter recalled the doctor abruptly yelling back at her. “You’re gonna wait like everybody else. ” Shaken, Easter later went to see her family doctor, who told her that the surgeon had taken notes on their meeting and raised “red flags” about her attitude  —   “as if I was the problem,” Easter said in a phone interview with The Washington Post on Wednesday. The Harris Health System, to which Easter’s hospital belongs, said in an email statement that confidentiality laws prevented it from commenting on specific cases without the patient’s “written authorization. ”    Ethel Easter secretly recorded her surgery using a tape recorder hidden in her hair. Easter says she was shocked by what she heard. (Fox26)   From the start, Easter was troubled that she didn’t trust her own surgeon, but she was in too much pain to cancel the operation. Then she had an idea: She would go through with the surgery  —   it was ultimately scheduled about a month later, for August  —   but she would sneak a recorder into the operating room so that her family could know what happened to her in case things went wrong. She had a “bad feeling,” after all. The audio recorder was the size of a USB drive. At the time, Easter had braided extensions in her hair. When she was changing into her hospital gown, she put her hair up in a ponytail and stuck the recorder inside. “I was fearful,” Easter said. “I didn’t know if I was going to come out of the surgery, so I just wanted my family to know if something went on. ” The surreptitious recording, parts of which she shared with The Post, became the most traumatic part of the experience. It began with the surgeon asking Easter about what happens to her when she takes penicillin. “When I was a baby, they said I swelled up,” Easter can be heard responding in the recording. An anesthesiologist then arrived, and Easter grew silent as she was instructed to just “keep breathing. You’re doing perfect. ” After Easter was sedated, the surgeon recounted their dispute to the other doctors. “She’s a handful,” he said in the recording. “She had some choice words for us in the clinic when we didn’t book her case in two weeks. ” “She said, ‘I’m going to call a lawyer and file a complaint,’” he recalled with a laugh. (Easter said she never mentioned a lawyer.) “That doesn’t seem like the thing to say to the person who’s going to do your surgery,” another male voice retorted.   [An anesthesiologist trashed her sedated colonoscopy patient  —   and it cost her $500, 000]   The comments afterward became personal. The surgeon and the anesthesiologist repeatedly referred to her belly button in jest. “Did you see her belly button?” one doctor said, followed by peals of laughter. At another point in the procedure, the anesthesiologist appeared to refer to Easter as “always the queen,” to which the surgeon responded, “I feel sorry for her husband. ” The surgeon also used the name “Precious” several times in a manner that Easter interpreted as racial. “Precious, yes, this is Precious over here, saying hi to Precious over there,” he can be heard saying in the recording, though it is unclear whom he is addressing. Moments later, he asked: “What do her eyes look like? You know the eyes are the windows to the soul. ” After the doctors concurred that there had been many “teaching moments” that day, the anesthesiologist asked, “Do you want me to touch her?” “I can touch her,” the surgeon is heard saying. “That’s a Bill Cosby suggestion,” someone interjected. “Everybody’s got things on phones these days. Everybody’s got a camera. ” “Do you have photos?” the surgeon asked a couple times. “[indiscernible] thought about it, but I didn’t do it. ” While much of the exact dialogue is difficult to discern from the recording, Easter was distressed by what she believed to be its subject matter. She thought “Precious” might be an allusion to the 2009 movie of the same name, chronicling the life of an illiterate African American teenager who suffers childhood abuse. “He called me Precious, an African American obese woman who was raped by her father,” Easter told The Post. She also thought the comments about “touching” and Bill Cosby were suggestive, and according to her, the surgeon said: “I thought about touching her. I could take pictures. ” “To think that I’m lying there,” Easter said, “and they’re talking about touching me inappropriately. Sexually. ”   [Opinion: Nurses make fun of their dying patients. And that’s okay.]   What bothered Easter the most were moments in the recording when, in her view, the doctors acted flippant about her health and  . She was disturbed that the surgeon talked on his cellphone at one point during the surgery, and even more so that he seemed unbothered by her penicillin allergy. He said in the recording that swelling and rashes were not severe enough reactions to preclude Easter from receiving Ancef, an antibiotic injection that causes side effects in a small percentage of   patients. The surgeon suggested first giving Easter a small dose as a trial. This would prove an unfortunate decision. At the end of the recording, a groggy Easter can be heard telling a doctor that she was “itchy. ” Shortly after the surgery, Easter said, her arms swelled up and started getting rashes, though her hernia was successfully repaired. Her husband brought her back to the hospital  —   this time to the emergency room, where she was treated for an allergic reaction. For several days, Easter said, she had trouble breathing. These symptoms prompted Easter to listen to the recording. She was angered by what she found. “He jeopardized my life,” Easter said. “It’s just by the grace of God that I’m even alive right now. It was an unnecessary risk that he took with me. ” Last fall, Easter sent the hospital a letter with her complaints with the recording attached. Stacey Mitchell, the administrative director of risk management and patient safety for the Harris Health System, responded by thanking her for providing them a copy of the recording “to better analyze your concerns. ” “With regards to the recording, as I explained in my prior correspondence, we reminded the OR staff and physicians to be mindful of their comments at all times,” Mitchell said in a letter dated December. “After carefully listening to the recording that you provided, Harris Health does not believe further action is warranted at this time. ” Mitchell also noted that the doctors in the recording are employees of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, not of the Harris Health System. The UT Health system likewise told ABC News that it could not comment on the case because of patient confidentiality laws. Easter has not decided whether to initiate legal action against the doctors and hospital. She said currently she just wants to “let everybody know what was going on  —   make people aware of what was happening. ” The experienced has changed Easter emotionally and psychologically, she said, and she now struggles with “trust issues. ” “Even my husband has said that I’m not the same person he married,” Easter said. What did she hope would come out of making the recording public? “If I had it my way,” Easter said, “I’d like them to come forward and apologize. Come forward and say, ‘We took an oath, and we violated it.’ This is for all the workers and the doctors: Don’t do this. Just treat people the way they would like their mother, their sister, their wives to be treated. ” Read more:   An anesthesiologist trashed her sedated colonoscopy patient  —   and it cost her $500, 000 Opinion: Nurses make fun of their dying patients.

            "Message: Fox News Poll: Clinton edges Trump by two points one month ahead of election Third party candidates Gary Johnson (6 percent) and Jill Stein (2 percent) are in single digits.   In the    matchup, Clinton tops Trump by   percent.  It was   percent last week.  Her lead is within the poll’s margin of error in both the   and   race. CLICK TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS. The GOP nominee has the advantage in interest and enthusiasm.  Among those backing Trump, 57 percent are “extremely” interested in the election, and 70 percent support him “strongly. ”  Among Clinton backers, it’s 50 percent “extremely” interested and 57 percent “strongly. ”   Trump is preferred among men (+9 points) whites (+16) voters who attend religious services regularly (+17) and whites without a college degree (+21).   See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → Clinton’s the choice for women (+12 points) voters under age 35 (+16) and   (+55).   Independents are divided:  Trump 39 percent vs. Clinton 35 percent, and another 11 percent for Johnson.  Last week, they favored Trump by 12 points.     percent of Democrats back Clinton and 84 percent of Republicans go for Trump. Clinton bests Trump among   voters by   percent, with Johnson taking 14 percent. ”I think it’s pretty clear that Clinton has a slight edge here,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw. ”Still, Trump is very much within striking distance largely because his backers are more enthusiastic, and also Johnson and Stein are drawing more support from voters who might otherwise lean toward Clinton.”  Likely voters trust Clinton over Trump on handling race relations (+23 points) foreign policy (+17) immigration (+6) and nominating the next Supreme Court justice (+4).  They prefer Trump on terrorism (+1 point) the economy (+5) managing tax dollars (+5) and ISIS (+11).  Majorities of voters still dislike the candidates:  54 percent of likely voters have an unfavorable view of Clinton, while 57 percent view Trump negatively.   GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence receives the best ratings of the four candidates tested, and his favorable rating is up five points among likely voters since last week.  More on that later. Who has the knowledge to be president?    percent say Clinton has it, while only 41 percent think Trump does.  In addition, 63 percent say Clinton has the temperament to serve effectively, compared to just 38 percent for Trump. The candidate ratings on being honest and trustworthy are more evenly matched    and much lower:  33 percent say Clinton is vs. 36 percent Trump. Among Democrats, 69 percent think Clinton is honest, 94 percent think she has the right temperament to be president, and 94 percent say she has the knowledge. Among Republicans, 71 percent think Trump is honest, 76 percent feel he has the temperament, and 78 percent say he has the knowledge. Meanwhile, by a   margin, voters feel confident Clinton would have good judgment in a crisis: 54 percent confident vs. 45 percent not confident.  Trump’s underwater by 10 points on this measure (  percent).    percent are “not at all” confident Trump would have good judgment in a crisis.    percent feel that way about Clinton.  That matters.  Judgment is a top trait voters say will influence their presidential pick.  Being a strong leader (21 percent) having good judgment in a crisis (20 percent) and bringing change (19 percent) are the three most important candidate characteristics.  Next is someone who “tells it like it is” (14 percent) and has the right experience (13 percent).  Eleven percent wants someone who “cares” about people like them.   “After the first debate it looked like Clinton might take a meaningful lead,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Shaw.  “That hasn’t happened, probably because so many voters view her unfavorably personally.  But unless Trump can close the gap on perceptions of temperament and judgment, he remains at a distinct disadvantage in a close race. ”  Most voters are unhappy with Uncle Sam.  Half are “dissatisfied with the way the government is working” (49 percent).  Some 27 percent are “angry. ”  Angry voters are more than three times as likely to favor Trump over Clinton. Clinton’s ties to the Obama administration are a mixed bag.  President Obama’s job rating has been 50 percent or better since June.  Currently, 52 percent of registered voters approve, while 47 percent disapprove of the job he’s doing. On the other hand, her closeness could hurt her on the economy.  By a   margin, registered voters say it feels like the economy is getting worse rather than better (  percent).  And that 52 percent who say the economy is getting worse is the highest since 2011. Pollpourri, Twice as many voters say news about Trump’s tax returns makes them less likely to vote for him.  It’s the reverse among Republicans    three times as many say the tax news makes them more likely to support him.  Trump’s “crooked Hillary” nickname is sticking.    percent of registered voters think it’s accurate, up from 49 percent who felt that way in June.   What about Clinton tagging Trump “a fraud”?    percent agree with that, up from 43 percent. All in all, 55 percent think Clinton will win in November.  That’s far more than the 33 percent who think it will be President Trump.      of those backing Clinton think she’ll win, while    Trump supporters think he will.    The poll was conducted Monday through Thursday evenings.  The voters contacted Wednesday and Thursday were asked about Tuesday’s vice presidential debate.  By a   percent margin, more think Republican Mike Pence won than Democrat Tim Kaine.  Indeed, only about half of Democrats feel Kaine won. Maybe VP debates do matter.  After a week of increased attention on the bottom of the ticket, Pence’s popularity is up and Kaine’s is down.  Among likely voters, Pence had a net rating of +11 points last week (42 favorable vs. 31 unfavorable).  Now he’s at +14 points (  percent). At the same time, Kaine lost ground and his unfavorable rating increased by nine points.  He had a net +12 last week (40 favorable vs. 28 unfavorable).  Now he’s at par, with equal numbers viewing him positively and negatively (  percent). The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1, 006 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw  Company Research (R) from October   2016.  The survey includes results among 896 likely voters.  The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters.   \n",

Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff was removed from her position, after an impeachment vote. The Inverted Politics of 2016: During an address in Cincinnati Wednesday, Hillary Clinton championed “American exceptionalism,” the idea that the United States is best suited to be a world leader. The GOP has embraced this concept in the past, but Donald Trump has disavowed it.

When a Democrat Defends Conservatism: In a recent speech, Hillary Clinton condemned the   movement, a “fringe group” of   extremists unified by “racialism” who support Donald Trump. The shameful thing, National Review’s Jonah Goldberg says, is that Clinton did what establishment conservatives simply have not. Is Trump Falling for Clinton’s Tricks?: The Republican nominee’s campaign has been spending valuable resources in Arizona and Georgia, two states that have voted Republican in recent elections. And Clinton’s team is taking credit for his distraction from the battleground zones.

            "Message: A Son In Chains. A Depressed Mom. Here’s What Helped It was a hospital  —   but to psychologist Inka Weissbecker it looked more like a prison. She had come to South Sudan to check out the country’s only health facility for treating patients with mental illness. ”There was a hallway leading past these cells with bars on them,” she recalls. ”Behind one set of bars I saw a mattress covered in plastic. And on it was urine and feces  —   and this woman lying with her face to the wall. I don’t know if she was dead or just sleeping. Nobody seemed to care.” The year was 2013 and Weissbecker was on a   mission for International Medical Corps in her capacity as the aid group’s adviser on global mental health and psychosocial issues. Shortly afterward she met with the representative of a major international organization that was bankrolling IMC’s work in South Sudan to plead for more funding for mental health services there. Weissbecker says she described not only the patients she’d seen at the hospital, but another image that haunts her to this day: a little girl wandering alone in the hallway. ”She must have been about 4 years old. She had on a little torn   and she looked completely lost, with these big eyes. Probably her mother was in the ward, but I don’t know for sure. Nobody was paying any attention to her.” Weissbecker says her presentation was short but ”impassioned.” Yet the donor was unmoved. ”The donor basically said, that’s all very nice, but South Sudan has so many other problems. There’s such high maternal mortality. We can’t afford to pay for mental health. In fact, I think his exact words were ’South Sudan is not ready for mental health.’ ” This week Weissbecker has been among a chorus of voices calling for a rethink of that attitude. The World Health Organization and the World Bank have been holding a groundbreaking conference in Washington on how to make funding of mental health care more of a priority  —   particularly in   and   countries. Like other advocates, Weissbecker points to statistics documenting the toll that mental illness takes on not just individuals but on national health systems and economies. She has seen this impact firsthand through her work with IMC, which has incorporated mental health services in the medical programs it runs in more than 20 countries. We asked her to tell us about the experiences that have affected her most profoundly  —   both successes and horror stories. Her first recollection comes from a camp for Somali refugees in Ethiopia, which she visited in 2013. There she met a father who for years had struggled with how to help his son. When the family lived in Somalia, a fragile country with very little health care, no one knew what was wrong with the boy. The family ”just saw him as violent, and aggressive, trying to run off all the time, speaking to people who weren’t actually there.” The father thought his son might be possessed by evil spirits and took him to a traditional healer. When that didn’t help, he kept him chained up. But things changed in the refugee camp. A psychiatric nurse working for IMC saw the chained man  —   then in his 20s  —   and was able to diagnose his schizophrenia and get him on medication. She also worked with the family to help them understand the source of the problem and the importance of working with the son to ensure he stayed on his medication. The result was  . ”He was able to improve to the extent that the father removed the chains,” says Weissbecker. ”He became part of the family again, contributing to daily chores. And the father told me he even went to his community to show them the chains and tell them, ’I used these chains on my son. But it turns out he just had a mental illness. And mental illness is treatable.’ It was such a powerful message.” Then there was the mother of two adolescent girls whom Weissbecker met in Gaza. She seemed a bright, confident woman, all smiles. But she told Weissbecker that for years she had struggled with crippling depression. ”She didn’t even have energy for housework. When the family would come over to cook together she’d just withdraw.” Unlike in Somalia or South Sudan, mental health care was available. But even as the woman’s daughters urged her to get help, she was daunted by another obstacle: the stigma around mental illness in many cultures. ”She would tell her daughters, I can’t go to a psychologist or psychiatrist. Only crazy people see them.” When, thanks to the continued encouragement of her daughters she finally did seek treatment she was so proud of the transformation that she became a volunteer with a program run by IMC to educate the community about depression. ”She really wanted to spread the message that you should not be ashamed.” As for her unsuccessful effort in South Sudan, Weissbecker said there was a bittersweet coda. Soon after her   meeting with the donor, the   conflicts there escalated once again. ”Suddenly all these donors were saying, ’Oh, there’s a crisis there. Everybody’s going to be traumatized and there will be a need for mental health care.’ So all this funding came through.” While she’s grateful that IMC has been able to use that assistance to offer services to people displaced by the violence, she says that ”South Sudan needs more than that  —   there is always a need for mental health. And there is a moral obligation to provide it.”\n",

            "Message: Trump’s expected VP pick: coal advocate who defied Obama’s climate agenda  Republican Donald Trump’s selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate cheered the U. S. energy industry and dismayed green advocates, with both sides citing Pence’s support for coal mining and defiance of President Barack Obama’s   agenda. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called climate change a hoax and promised to gut U. S. environmental regulations in order to help the ailing oil and coal sectors. A   ticket will quash any expectation that the New York businessman might soften that stance heading into the Nov. 8 election. ”Governor Pence has been a vocal opponent of the administration’s Clean Power Plan,” said Laura Sheehan, spokeswoman for the   lobby group American Council on Clean Coal Electricity.   ”We would hope to see a continuation,” she said. Trump announced Pence as his running mate in a Twitter post on Friday morning, ending days of speculation over the choice ahead of the party’s national convention in Cleveland next week. [nL1N1A10HR] Pence, 57, is listed on Obama’s “call out the climate change deniers” website for arguing that the science behind climate change has not yet been resolved. In June 2015, Pence wrote to Obama saying that Indiana, America’s eighth largest   state, would not comply with the Clean Power Plan regulating power plant emissions, calling it ” .” Indiana is one of more than 25 states that have challenged the centerpiece of the Democratic president’s environmental agenda. In 2014, Pence alarmed local environmental groups by overturning an energy efficiency program enacted by his Republican predecessor, Mitch Daniels, saying it was too expensive for the state’s manufacturers. The Indiana Public Utility Commission had estimated the program would create more than 18, 600 jobs. ”The choice of Pence shows Trump has little interest in appealing to anyone outside of his extremist base and Big Polluters,” said Clay Schroers, a director at the League of Conservation Voters environmental group.     SUPPORT FOR TRADITIONAL ENERGY Trump has long signaled his support of traditional energy production   part of his broader appeal to   American voters.  He outlined plans in May to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by Obama, scrap the Paris Climate Accord, and revive the Keystone XL pipeline proposal  —   moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement. Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in contrast, has promised more stringent regulation of the energy sector, efforts to boost renewable fuels use, and a commitment to join other nations to combat global climate change. Pence ran for governor in 2012 after serving in the U. S. Congress. His campaign for governor received more than $850, 000 from the energy sector, about 3 percent of the total, according to campaign finance disclosures. More than $300, 000 of that came from the billionaire Koch brothers, strong advocates of small government and fiscal conservatism who took a liking to Pence. Both David and Charles Koch have said they will not support the Trump ticket. Trump has alarmed many Republican establishment figures with his fiery rhetoric on immigration and trade.  But a former   operative in the Koch political organization who is close to both brothers said Pence could help make the donor network more receptive to Trump’s campaign.

President Donald Trump on Friday at the G20 summit in Germany will last about 30 minutes and probably not lead to any major agreements, Mexico’s foreign minister said on Wednesday. NEW YORK The U. S. government on Wednesday proposed to reduce the volume of biofuel required to be used in gasoline and diesel fuel next year as it signaled the first step toward a potential broader overhaul of its biofuels program. \n",

I hope you’ll enjoy reading them as much as I did. + + + How Air Jordan Became Crying JordanIan Crouch | The New Yorker, It has become difficult to separate Jordan from the images of him that were sold to consumers. But he was no marketing cipher. The things that advertisers said were cool about him were actually cool: the wagging tongue the acrobatic leaps the clutch shots on the biggest stages the shining, perfectly round bald head the deadpan sense of humor and easy smile. The Jumpman logo that adorns his   of Nike shoes and apparel? He could really jump like that. . .. If you’ve spent any time on the Internet recently, there’s a good chance you’ve seen an image of Michael Jordan’s tearful face superimposed on someone else’s body. The meme, known as Crying Jordan, has been around for several years, but became ubiquitous on the Web starting this past fall. Whenever someone —  an athlete, an actor, a politician —  fails in a public way, his face will promptly be replaced by Jordan’s. When Donald Trump lost the Iowa caucuses, he became Crying Jordan.
