They set up a Google form for people to send in their own estimates and share sources. The   protest set for Jan. 21 keeps running into weird trouble. Organizers’ dodge: Claim the whole thing is a tribute to King.) It’s almost as if no one’s treating this thing seriously. Women’s March organizers prepare for hundreds of thousands of protesters At about 10am on Saturday, as a quarter of a million or more people gather in protest at the base of Capitol Hill for the Women’s March on Washington, the newly minted President Donald Trump will be on his knees at “a service of prayer and reflection” at the National Cathedral. But the roar of the masses will surely reach the president’s ears later, as the speeches and   performers wrap up the    hour rally and the demonstrators march to the Ellipse, the large green space opposite the White House. I put a lot of my energy under Obama into supporting black women’s leadership and women’s leadership overall  —   we could have broken the glass ceiling with Hillary Clinton and it didn’t happen, so that’s what’s motivated me to take part,” she added. Pingree said Trump was the most unpredictable incoming president most people had ever witnessed. She saw in it coded language designed to further divide rather than unite voters and to erase civil liberties, she said.\n"
