50170,53463,73686,The Exhausting Work of Tallying America’s Largest Protest,Atlantic,Kaveh Waddell,2017-01-23,2017.0,1.0,,"But over the weekend, as President Donald Trump fought with the media over the attendance at his inauguration —  experts’ estimates put the crowd at about 160, 000 people, while Trump falsely claimed an attendance of 1. 5 million —  a pair of   professors began work on a sprawling database that compiles attendance numbers from every protest, demonstration, and march affiliated with the Women’s March on Washington that they could find. On Saturday, Jeremy Pressman, a professor of political science at the University of Connecticut, was planning to attend a Women’s March in Hartford. Before he set out, he wondered if anyone was assembling on a spreadsheet to track attendance at the various marches. He asked on Twitter, and soon, someone replied, “Don’t know, but hope so!” Pressman tweeted back: “I’m starting one. ” Pressman scoured the internet for links to news stories with   estimates. He added each to a Google spreadsheet, with a high and low estimate for attendance in each city he found. Within two hours, he tweeted an early version of the spreadsheet. His post attracted the attention of Erica Chenoweth, a professor at the University of Denver and an expert on nonviolent protest. Chenoweth offered to help with the tedious, long work of compiling news reports, and by Sunday morning, Pressman had an initial estimate: Between 3. 6 and 4. 6 million people had marched the day before. (At press time, the   estimate has fallen to 3. 3 million.) As my colleague Conor wrote this morning, even the bottom line would make the Women’s March the largest protest in United States history. At first, most of the data came from news reports, but before long, “social media started working,” Pressman told me. People started tweeting new information at Pressman and Chenoweth, and some dug up the professors’ emails in order to send in more detailed reports. They set up a Google form for people to send in their own estimates and share sources. The spreadsheet currently has entries for nearly 550 cities and towns in the U. S. from the march in D. C. (470, 000 to 680, 000 participants) to a protest in Show Low, Arizona (one participant). The spreadsheet also tallies attendance at rallies in more than 100 cities around the world. Chenoweth studies emerging political movements, so she jumped on the opportunity to watch a new one perhaps begin to unfold here in the U. S. But more fundamentally, she said, the act of counting itself is an important one. “It’s a really empowering thing to be noticed and to be tallied,” she said. “That actually came to be much more evident to me when people started emailing us and tweeting at us, reporting that they had two, five, seven, 12 people in their tiny outpost. ” The Women’s March has some of the hallmarks of the beginning of a successful movement, Chenoweth said. The ability to mobilize large numbers of people is often associated with the creation of an effective campaign. The fact that the march was inclusive and broad rather than tied to a specific policy goal helped draw big numbers, Chenoweth said, and the explicitly   nature of the protests helped attract even more. The level of organization on display at events large to small bodes well for the social movement, as does the proportion of march participants who aren’t usually politically engaged. As the researchers keep gathering data, they’re grappling with the implications of suddenly becoming the stewards of sensitive information. When they started out on Saturday, they didn’t expect that people would report their own participation in marches. Their submission form doesn’t ask for any identifying information, and Chenoweth says they’re taking care not to expose those who emailed in to say they participated in a demonstration from a personal or work address. Chenoweth and Pressman’s spreadsheet is separate from another effort to gather attendance data using SMS messaging. This text census, which was put together by an organization called It’s Time Network, has raised questions about privacy and its affiliation with the organizers of the Women’s March. In person and on social media, demonstrators were urged to text the words “count me” to the number 89800. Those instructions were boosted by celebrities like Jamie Lee Curtis and George Takei, who have large followings on Twitter. Despite appearing at first to be an official effort from the Women’s March organizers themselves, the march’s official Twitter account briefly tweeted, then deleted, a message distancing itself from the headcount, according to Snopes. A spokesperson for It’s Time Networks, which partners with organizations focused on empowering women and girls, said the confusion was the result of “an unfortunate miscommunication. ” It’s Time Network had been in touch with the organizers of the Women’s March since early January, the spokesperson said, and had offered to turn over all the data they gathered by SMS —  they asked participants for their phone number, zip code, email, and where they marched —  to the organizers. It’s unclear whether the march organizers ever officially endorsed the text census —  emails to a spokesperson for the Women’s March weren’t returned —  or what they plan to do with the data they’ll receive. While participants were asked to text in order to be counted, one of the main goals of the campaign is to build a list of phone numbers that belong to people who demonstrated on Saturday, or who supported the marches. If the march organizers choose to, they’ll be able to send messages to the list of people who asked to be counted. Some privacy advocates pointed out on Twitter that the number that march participants were asked to text —  89800 —  appears to be connected to a company that uses the number to send up to eight monthly “alerts regarding promotions, coupons, and time sensitive deals from local businesses. ” The   message associated with the marketing line, however, is “DEALMEIN” rather than “count me. ” The company that appears to maintain 89800, txtwire, could not be reached for comment. Chenoweth said she spoke with representatives of It’s Time Network a few weeks ago, and cautioned against using SMS messaging to gather data on march participants. “I don’t know if you guys want to be liable for keeping people’s personal information about their participation,” she warned. “If you are, make sure that people know the risks of   at an individual level. ” She and Pressman are still building out their census spreadsheet, and they’ve already enlisted at least one research assistant for help. “I view this as a first cut,” Pressman said of the spreadsheet as it stands. He told me he wanted to break out participation by U. S. state —  and within hours of our conversation, a new tab appeared on the spreadsheet that did just that. The pair is thinking about ways to institutionalize their ad hoc   operation to track future events. For now, they hope that a running count of will offer march leaders and participants a rare commodity in organizing: a way to measure their success.","The Exhausting Work of Tallying America’s Largest Protest But over the weekend, as President Donald Trump fought with the media over the attendance at his inauguration —  experts’ estimates put the crowd at about 160, 000 people, while Trump falsely claimed an attendance of 1. 5 million —  a pair of   professors began work on a sprawling database that compiles attendance numbers from every protest, demonstration, and march affiliated with the Women’s March on Washington that they could find.

","Is the Women’s March on Washington cursed? The   protest set for Jan. 21 keeps running into weird trouble.  Start with the name, originally the Million Women’s March. The three white feminists who thought up the idea felt obliged to change that title after they faced charges of “cultural appropriation. ” No joke: An early comment on   complained of “white feminists taking the name of something that Black people started to address our struggles. ” You see, 1997 saw a Million Woman March in DC for    —   a follow to Louis Farrakhan’s 1995 Million Man March. Even the new name prompted grumbles that it “appropriates” from the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  1963 March on Washington. (Organizers’ dodge: Claim the whole thing is a tribute to King.) And,   the event’s page is still plagued with “arguments about whether an event organized primarily by white women can be sufficiently ‘intersectional’  —   or attuned to the issues faced by, say, poor minority women who reside at the ‘intersection’ of class, race, and gender concerns in America. ” The march, she charges, “is shaping up to be a   exercise in search of a cause. ”  But it’s The Washington Post’s debacle that makes us suspect a curse: Thursday’s edition of the paper’s free giveaway, Express, was all about the march  —   but the cover was dominated by a giant male symbol, rather than the female one. It’s almost as if no one’s treating this thing seriously.","The Women’s March on Washington is becoming a joke Is the Women’s March on Washington cursed?

96616,100075,147468,Women’s March organizers prepare for hundreds of thousands of protesters,Guardian,Joanna Walters,2017-01-20,2017.0,1.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/20/womens-march-washington-donald-trump-protest,"At about 10am on Saturday, as a quarter of a million or more people gather in protest at the base of Capitol Hill for the Women’s March on Washington, the newly minted President Donald Trump will be on his knees at “a service of prayer and reflection” at the National Cathedral. From that perch four miles away from the White House he won’t, initially, be able to hear the civil rights legend Angela Davis, the feminist icon Gloria Steinem or the   campaigner Cecile Richards addressing the crowds at the march. But the roar of the masses will surely reach the president’s ears later, as the speeches and   performers wrap up the    hour rally and the demonstrators march to the Ellipse, the large green space opposite the White House. He may even see them if he steps out on to the balcony in the residence to admire the view of the Washington Monument. “I hope he will be praying about how to be the president of all the people. We are not going to let our rights be rolled back by anyone,” Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and a speaker at the march, said. The march organizers are still officially only expecting a crowd of 200, 000 to 250, 000 people  —   mostly women, but also many men  —   based on the number who have registered. But those close to the planning acknowledge that they are prepared, in coordination with the police, city officials and thousands of volunteers and private security staff, if the numbers swell considerably, to half a million or beyond. The event is expected to turn into one of the largest marches in US history and although it is not billed specifically as an   protest, most of the causes represented are those deemed under threat from the new administration. “I’m speaking out and marching because healthcare is under attack and women’s reproductive rights are under attack. So many awful things were said about women by the incoming president,” said Campbell. “I put a lot of my energy under Obama into supporting black women’s leadership and women’s leadership overall  —   we could have broken the glass ceiling with Hillary Clinton and it didn’t happen, so that’s what’s motivated me to take part,” she added. Campbell took exception to Trump’s gloomy inaugural speech and his portraiture of inner cities as being in a state of a   “American carnage”. “That’s not the urban America I know. Not that there are not problems, but it’s not all rocked with violence and poverty. America is already great, it’s a melting pot and must continue to be,” she said. On Saturday morning, Campbell and other speakers’ voices will boom out from jumbotrons positioned among the thousands packing along Independence Avenue, calling for action on racial equality, climate change, criminal justice reform, a higher minimum wage, immigrants’ rights and a host of other progressive issues. Among those on stage or seated next to the stage in VIP seating will be some of the   members of Congress from the Democratic party who were set to boycott Trump’s inauguration ceremony on Friday.  One of those is US representative Chellie Pingree. While Trump was being sworn in on Friday, she was visiting a Planned Parenthood center and a business owned by immigrants in her home state of Maine, before flying to Washington in the afternoon to get ready for the march. On Saturday morning, she will gather with fellow politicians on stage at the rally and then march with some of the 5, 000 women attending from the state of Maine. “We need to do everything we can to let the incoming administration know we are not happy about their agenda. I’ve had unprecedented numbers of my constituents calling me worried about healthcare, the environment, public education, and they feel disrespected,” she said. Pingree said Trump was the most unpredictable incoming president most people had ever witnessed. While Trump struggled to get   names to perform at his inauguration celebrations, the Women’s March on Washington has attracted singing and acting stars such as Katy Perry America Ferrera, who is also speaking at the rally the Orange is the New Black cast member Uzo Aduba the actor Scarlett Johansson Cher and the young actor and singer Zendaya. The march grew organically, from a feminist outcry on Facebook in the immediate aftershock of the election result. Organizers now hope it will kickstart a new era of grassroots activism across a long list of progressive issues chiefly related to equality and social and economic justice. What began as an expression of frustration and a call to action on social media then morphed into a mass mobilization across multiple progressive causes. The event began to be physically realized on Friday as buses, trains and planes started pouring into Washington, packed full of women  —   and supportive male friends dotted among them. Although   sister marches are taking place in as many as 300 cities across all 50 states, as well as internationally, thousands chose the capital city to make their presence felt next to the Capitol and the White House. “This is what a plane full of women who are ready to resist the Trump agenda looks like,” read one tweet, showing a flight bound for DC packed with women smiling and waving ecstatically, some wearing pink knit “pussy hats” that have become an informal uniform for the march. “I am a woman of color and a Muslim from an immigrant family whose country is now going to be led by someone who has been openly   and sexist, has attacked Muslims and is surrounding himself with some horrible people for his cabinet,” said Zahra Billoo, director of the San Francisco chapter of the Council on   Relations and a speaker at the march. “I don’t think that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is racist, but they were willing to overlook that part of his campaign for whatever reason, and that’s not acceptable. We’ve seen the fallout, in hate crimes, and there is a need for inspiration and community across racial lines, religious lines, family lines, across many communities in America right now,” she said. Billoo said she found Trump’s inaugural speech “no better than so many of his campaign speeches”. She saw in it coded language designed to further divide rather than unite voters and to erase civil liberties, she said.  “All of this ‘America first’ is one way of saying if you don’t agree with us, we will come after you,” she said. Following scuffles and arrests in protests coinciding with the inauguration on Friday, Billoo said she hoped the Women’s March on Washington itself would be a wholly peaceful rally and demonstration. The march is due to finish at dusk. But Linda Sarsour, one of the four march   hopes that the end of the event will mark the beginning of a new movement. “Making the march happen has been one of the largest grassroots efforts that anyone has ever seen. This is a mass mobilization and we intend to hold the administration to account,” she said.","Women’s March organizers prepare for hundreds of thousands of protesters At about 10am on Saturday, as a quarter of a million or more people gather in protest at the base of Capitol Hill for the Women’s March on Washington, the newly minted President Donald Trump will be on his knees at “a service of prayer and reflection” at the National Cathedral.

Although   sister marches are taking place in as many as 300 cities across all 50 states, as well as internationally, thousands chose the capital city to make their presence felt next to the Capitol and the White House. “This is what a plane full of women who are ready to resist the Trump agenda looks like,” read one tweet, showing a flight bound for DC packed with women smiling and waving ecstatically, some wearing pink knit “pussy hats” that have become an informal uniform for the march. “I am a woman of color and a Muslim from an immigrant family whose country is now going to be led by someone who has been openly   and sexist, has attacked Muslims and is surrounding himself with some horrible people for his cabinet,” said Zahra Billoo, director of the San Francisco chapter of the Council on   Relations and a speaker at the march. “I don’t think that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is racist, but they were willing to overlook that part of his campaign for whatever reason, and that’s not acceptable. We’ve seen the fallout, in hate crimes, and there is a need for inspiration and community across racial lines, religious lines, family lines, across many communities in America right now,” she said. Billoo said she found Trump’s inaugural speech “no better than so many of his campaign speeches”. She saw in it coded language designed to further divide rather than unite voters and to erase civil liberties, she said.  “All of this ‘America first’ is one way of saying if you don’t agree with us, we will come after you,” she said. Following scuffles and arrests in protests coinciding with the inauguration on Friday, Billoo said she hoped the Women’s March on Washington itself would be a wholly peaceful rally and demonstration. The march is due to finish at dusk. But Linda Sarsour, one of the four march   hopes that the end of the event will mark the beginning of a new movement. “Making the march happen has been one of the largest grassroots efforts that anyone has ever seen. This is a mass mobilization and we intend to hold the administration to account,” she said."
